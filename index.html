            <h2 class="h2index">Summary</h2>
            <p>This white paper is intended to help readers better understand the issues involved in making Web sites accessible to people with disabilities, a legal obligation that also benefits all users of the Web. We will deal with the current issues in accessibility, as well as the various initiatives, norms, and standards implemented with respect to Web-enabled applications. In this regard, we will examine using Microsoft products and technologies to design and develop Web sites that comply with accessibility guidelines.</p>
            <p>More specifically, this document describes a set of guidelines that enable you to produce accessible Web sites by using the new Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 technologies as part of Microsoft Office system 2007 or previous solutions such as Content Management Server 2002 and SharePoint 2003 technologies. It defines the extent to which these technologies offer the best possible compliance with, as a minimum, the priority 1 checkpoints of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0.</p>
            <h2 class="h2index">Status</h2>
            <p>This document is the second release of the technical white paper on the accessibility of Web sites that are based on Microsoft solutions; it references the standards that were available at the date of publication and the features available in current versions of the above-mentioned products and technologies at the date of publication. This document will be updated as required based on product modifications.</p>
