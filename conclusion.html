<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This document introduces the concept of eAccessibility and describes the issues involved, as well as the nature of the problems that require solutions. It provides an overview of initiatives, norms, and standards that apply to Web applications if we are to provide better accessibility to a broad public.</p>

<p>This document examines Microsoft products and technologies with respect to the design and production of accessible Web sites, analyzing the capabilities of these technologies to comply with WCAG 1.0 checkpoints of all three priority levels. It is intended to provide reference guidelines for producing accessible Web sites that are based on the new Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 or previous solutions such as Content Management Server 2002 and SharePoint 2003 technologies. We encourage a systematic approach to Web site accessibility throughout the entire project lifecycle, supported by an appropriate testability plan.</p>

<p>The major guiding principles described here for the design and production phases in Web site creation, as well as the technical issues involved, are expected to remain stable when the new international WCAG 2.0 guidelines are released, which is anticipated sometime in 2007. The Internet accessibility guidelines practiced by European administrations will also evolve at that time, as indicated in the introduction, to converge towards the new international standards and criteria for success.</p>

<p>Although the Microsoft products and technologies addressed in this document are able to meet the requirements for providing accessible Web sites today, these products and technologies continuously evolve providing new features that support eAccessibility, in accordance with Microsoft's commitment to eInclusion.</p>
