            <h1>Accessibility Guidelines for Using SharePoint 2003 Technologies for Web Implementations</h1>

SharePoint products and technologies facilitate team participation at the enterprise level.</p>
Prior to Microsoft Office system 2007, through the combined features of Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 2.0 and SharePoint Portal Server (SPS) 2003, users can build their own SharePoint 2003 Web sites and make them accessible throughout the enterprise.</p>

SPS 2003 is a scalable gateway server that enables knowledge sharing between individuals or entire teams. SPS 2003:</p>

Ensures secure integration of multiple systems by way of federated authentication through single sign-on and enterprise application integration capabilities.</p>

Provides flexible tools for Web site deployment and management.</p>

Facilitates teamwork through aggregation, organization, and search capabilities (supporting people, team, and information search).</p>

Lets users locate the information they require quickly, through content targeting and customization of portal content and layout.</p>

WSS 2.0 (a component of Windows Server 2003 R2) is a Web site creation engine that provides powerful information-sharing and document-based collaborative solutions. SharePoint 2003 Web sites represent a new standard in file management, from uploads to data sharing, enabling users to work collaboratively on documents, tasks, contacts, and events. These sites enable teams and Web site managers to easily manage Web site activity and content.</p>

SPS 2003 makes use of WSS 2.0 by using SharePoint sites to create diverse portal content to effectively disseminate information, targeting individual or enterprise-wide needs. These sites are specific to SPS 2003, but they use technologies such as Web Parts and SharePoint Document Libraries, which are provided by WSS. SPS 2003 also extends the possibilities of WSS 2.0 by providing organizational and management tools for SharePoint Web sites. Use of the Site Registry enables organizations to aggregate, organize, find, and provision SharePoint sites across the enterprise. In addition, SPS 2003 enables users to disseminate information and documents that are stored in their WSS Web sites throughout the enterprise.</p>

For additional information about SharePoint technologies, refer to the links for WSS 2.0 and SPS 2003 respectively at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/sharepoint/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/sharepoint/default.mspx</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/sharepoint/prodinfo/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/office/sharepoint/prodinfo/default.mspx</a>.</p>

4.1 Evaluation of SharePoint 2003 Web sites for WCAG 1.0 checkpoints</h2>

This white paper evaluates the use of SharePoint 2003 technologies for creating Web sites that comply with the checkpoints defined for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#Guidelines">14 guidelines in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0</a>, which were developed by the W3C/WAI and published 5 May 1999 (see section 1.3.1 &quot;WCAG 1.0&quot;). Sometime after WCAG 2.0 is approved and released, a future version of this document will evaluate compliance with the guidelines in the new release. style='background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow'></p>

To assess how SharePoint 2003 technologies support and satisfy WCAG 1.0 guidelines, this document considers whether WSS 2.0 and, consequently, SPS 2003 support the checkpoints, or in some cases, how these products can be adapted to ensure compliance with the checkpoints.</p>

This assessment takes into account the following documents: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/c/2/3/c23bc250-5f80-4d0c-a29d-877355ff91e8/WindowsSharepointServices_VPAT.doc" title="VPAT de SharePoint Services 1.0">Windows SharePoint Services 2003 VPAT</a> and <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/c/2/3/c23bc250-5f80-4d0c-a29d-877355ff91e8/SharePointPortalServer2003_VPAT.doc" title="VPAT de SharePoint Portal Server 2003">SharePoint Portal Server 2003 VPAT</a>.</p>

WSS 2.0 and SPS 2003 are the latest releases available at the date of publication of this white paper. For additional information, refer to the following links:</p>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=B922B28D-806A-427B-A4C5-AB0F1AA0F7F9&amp;displaylang=fr" title="Windows SharePoint Services 2.0 avec Service Pack 2">Windows SharePoint Services 2.0 with Service Pack 2</a>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=171DC9A7-B4BA-4759-BD64-6B7D851A97EF&amp;displaylang=en" title="SharePoint Portal Server 2003 Service Pack 2">SharePoint Portal Server 2003 Service Pack 2</a>

These two Service Packs provide Microsoft SQL Server 2005 support.</p>

WSS 2.0 with SP2 runs on the new Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Common Language Runtime (CLR), which means that it can run using ASP.NET 2.0 technology. However, WSS has not been redesigned to take advantage of any of the new major features of ASP.NET 2.0. At the core level, SP2 does not change the rendering behavior of WSS. In other words, WSS 2.0 cannot use Master Pages or the Web Parts 2.0 Framework. However, these new class libraries are available for customized Web Parts, Web pages, and event handlers.</p>

WSS 2.0 SP2 treats .NET 2.0 Web Parts as standard Web controls and not as Web Parts. One alternative is to write a wrapper Web Part to make the ASP.NET 2.0 Web Part appear to be a WSS 2.0 Web Part.</p>

However, SPS 2003 does not support .NET Framework 2.0, even with SP2, which requires <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9C552114-DC9A-43EE-9281-B080B7C280B4" title="Service Pack 2 de Windows SharePoint Services 2.0">Service Pack 2 of Windows SharePoint Services 2.0</a>. A SPS 2003 SP2 configuration with WSS 2.0 with SP2 is based on .NET Framework 1.1. This does not interfere with a SharePoint site running under ASP.NET 1.1 calling pages and Web services exposed by an ASP.NET 2.0 Web site.</p>

Additional details are provided in the article <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HA100806971033.aspx" title="Service Pack 2 for Windows SharePoint Services and SharePoint Portal Server 2003">Service Pack 2 for Windows SharePoint Services and SharePoint Portal Server 2003</a>.</p>
The MOSS 2007 technologies (see chapter 

Accessibility guidelines for using MOSS 2007 technologies for Web implementations), as a major release of both WSS 2.0 and SPS 2003, are based on, and hence make extensive use of, ASP.NET 2.0 and its multitude of features, including eAccessibility capabilities. See the MSDN article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/aspnetusstan.asp" title="Building ASP.NET 2.0 Web Sites Using Web Standards">Building ASP.NET 2.0 Web Sites Using Web Standards</a>, which describes these capabilities<strong> .</strong></p>
<strong>Given the above, the following analysis is based on running WSS 2.0 with .NET Framework 1.1 with Service Pack 1.</strong></p>
<strong>Service Pack 1 includes patch 819945 </strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;819945" title="FIX: ASP.NET Controls Do Not Meer Accessibility Guidelines">FIX: ASP.NET Controls Do Not Meet Accessibility Guidelines</a>


4.1.1 Graphics</h3>
1.1: Does each graphic have text to display as an alternative to the graphic?</p>


<em>

In HTML, use the ALT attribute with IMG and AREA SHAPE elements, and so forth. It is important to provide alternate text for graphics because some browsers and screen readers cannot interpret or display graphics properly.</em></p>

Type of criterion: development</p>


Can be accomplished: Yes</p>

Comments:
WSS 2.0 and SPS 2003 can be used to create Web pages that satisfy this criterion. You can edit the page with Microsoft Office Front Page 2003 or the new Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007 to take advantage of the tight integration between these products and technologies.</p>

Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007 works with the same types of Web sites as Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003 in addition to the specific support of MOSS 2007 technologies (see chapter 

Accessibility guidelines
for using MOSS 2007 technologies for Web implementations). These include Web sites built on Windows SharePoint Services, disk-based Web sites, and Web sites built on FrontPage Server Extensions. Office SharePoint Designer 2007 can also open and edit Web sites directly with the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocols.</p>
The best approach is to set up a site definition that integrates this criterion as described in the MSDN article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/odc_SP2003_ta/html/Office_SharePointAccessibility.asp" title="Tips for Enhancing the Accessibility of SharePoint Web Sites">Tips for Enhancing the Accessibility of SharePoint Web Sites</a>, in
section &quot;Use Alternative Text for Images.&quot; This article illustrates how to use these products to create more accessible Web sites while waiting for some already-identified accessibility problems to be resolved in an upcoming release of Office.</p>
HiSoftware offers a free download of <a href="http://www.hisoftware.com/spwhitepaper/sptmpreq.htm" title="nouveaux modles SharePoint ">new SharePoint templates</a> (in English), which you can use to create Web sites with integrated accessibility.</p>
It remains the responsibility of SharePoint 2003 developers to ensure that their Web pages satisfy this criterion. However, using site definitions does not enable developers to manage all HTML rendering issues. It is possible to appropriately modify ASPX pages, such as default.aspx, that are integrated in the site definitions. However, this does not influence the standard SharePoint controls that might include the page under consideration. Some controls might need to be rewritten for the rendering to comply with all the relevant criteria. It might be necessary to produce new site definitions that contain new versions of certain SPS 2003 controls (browsing, for example).</p>
1.2: Is the alternate text for each image relevant to the context in which the image is viewed?</p>


A given image might have several meanings. It is the context of the image that determines the exact meaning. For example, a yellow bullet icon in a newspaper Web site should have the ALT attribute set to ALT=&quot;&quot; or ALT=&quot;*&quot;. However, if the same yellow bullet icon is included in a list of graphics that is available for download, it might make more sense to set the attribute to ALT = &quot;yellow diamond&quot; to distinguish it from other graphics available on the page.</p>

Comments:
See 1.1 in this section. This criterion is subjective.
</p>
1.3:
Are graphics that are used only for decorative purposes commented with ALT=&quot;&quot;?</p>


Some graphics have no informative value. An example is the use of transparent pixels only for layout purposes. However, all graphical elements must be commented. For this reason, graphics that are used only for decorative or layout purposes should be commented by setting the ALT attribute to null (in HTML, ALT=&quot;&quot;). Some browsers do not display the images that use this type of comment.</p>

1.4:
Is the alternate text for each image no more than 60 characters long?</p>


You
should use a maximum of 60 characters in the ALT attribute because alternate text
might bother some users. This is often the case for people who use a screen
magnification function because of visual disabilities. It is important to limit
the number of characters in the image comments so that such users can minimize
the effort required to obtain all the information.</p>

1.5:
Are all comments that are linked to clickable areas of a MAP image relevant?</p>


Definition:
a MAP image is an image that presents clickable areas so that the user can
click to select an option. When you use a MAP image in HTML (on the client or the
server side), it is important to include alternate text for all clickable
areas, as well as for the MAP image itself (that is, the image that contains
the USEMAP or ISMAP attribute).</p>
For a
MAP image on the client side, provide alternate text by using the ALT attribute
in each of the clickable areas (AREA SHAPE).</p>
For a
MAP image on the server side, provide redundant text links that repeat the
content of each of the clickable areas.</p>
Comment
1: The alternate text provided for the image that contains the USEMAP or
ISMAPattribute must not be null.</p>
Comment
2: It is recommended that MAP images be used on the client side rather than on
the server side.</p>

Comments:
WSS 2.0 and SPS 2003 do not contain and cannot generate standard MAP images.</p>
It remains the responsibility of SharePoint 2003 developers, when creating templates that use this feature, to ensure that their Web pages satisfy this criterion. The solution is to systematically fill in the ALT attribute that is associated with the tag containing the USEMAP attribute (in addition to the images). Each clickable area (AREA SHAPE attribute) must include an appropriate ALT attribute.</p>
1.6: Is the alternate content for each text image at least the equivalent of the text appearing in the image?</p>
It is not recommended that you present text in the form of an image. However, if there is an unavoidable graphical constraint (for example, non-equivalent CSS rendering), the alternate text for a graphical element containing text should, at minimum, present the exact content of the text itself. The alternate text can provide additional information, but it must at least provide the exact content.</p>

1.7:
Do all images that require a detailed description provide comment text?</p>
When a graphical element requires a long description in HTML (for example, a complex image or alternate text longer than 60 characters) a text comment must be provided. The comment can be a link to a descriptive file (for example, a D-link or a clickable graphic), a caption that appears directly on the page, or a LONGDESC attribute.</p>

Comments:
WSS 2.0 and SPS 2003 can be used to create Web pages that satisfy this criterion. The LONGDESC attribute can be added by using FrontPage 2003 to edit the page. The best approach is to create a site definition that integrates this criterion.</p>


The WCAG directive specifies that the LONGDESC attribute should be used, but currently most browsers do not support it. Internet Explorer 6.0 exposes this attribute from a programming point of view in its model object. Therefore, assistive technologies can make use of it. <a href="http://www.hackcraft.net/longdesclink/default.asp" title="Longdesc Linker for Internet Explorer 6">Longdesc Linker for Internet Explorer 6</a> is a free downloadable ActiveX component that makes it possible to add a Long Description element to the context menu used by Internet Explorer for images. This element is enabled if the selected image has a LONGDESC link. If the user selects the link (by holding down the SHIFT key while selecting), Internet Explorer follows it.</p>
1.8:
If a detailed description is provided for an image, is the content relevant?</p>

The content should provide additional information to the description defined in the ALT attribute for the image.</p>

1.9:
Does the text used in the ALT attribute for each image provide the function of
the link?</p>


The
image description is not always in keeping with the function of the link. For
example, if an arrow is used to indicate a link, use ALT=&quot;Next&quot;
instead of ALT=&quot;Right Arrow&quot;. Avoid using ALT=&quot;&quot;, which
provides no information about the function of the link.</p>

Comments:
WSS 2.0 and SPS 2003 can be used to create Web pages that
satisfy this criterion. The solution is to place an ALT attribute between the
&lt;IMG&gt; tags embedded in an &lt;A&gt; tag, making sure that the text is
relevant.</p>

It remains the
responsibility of SharePoint 2003 developers to ensure that their Web pages
satisfy this criterion.</p>

4.1.2
 Frames</h3>
2.1:
Does each frame have a NAME attribute?</p>


In
HTML, each frame must be named by using the NAME attribute. Browsing through
frame-based Web pages can be complex, especially for visually impaired people
who become familiar with site content frame by frame (whereas sighted people
have an overview of the entire site). Comment: The content of the NAME
attribute should not include any spaces.</p>

2.2:
Are the names assigned to frames relevant?</p>


The names
assigned to frames should be relevant. Avoid naming frames with directional
data, such as &quot;Left,&quot; &quot;Right,&quot; or &quot;Middle.&quot; It is
better to name frames with explicit names that refer to the function provided
by the frame, such as &quot;Menu,&quot; &quot;Navigation,&quot; or
&quot;Content.&quot;</p>

In HTML, a frame can no longer be scaled if scrolling is set to &quot;NO.&quot; The scrolling function must be enabled. For users of magnification software, which might implement user-specific style sheets with larger fonts, and so forth, in-frame scrolling must be enabled to allow all content to be accessed.</p>

 Colors</h3>
3.1: Is information provided by color still readable when colors are disabled?</p>
Web site designers must be particularly careful about information provided by colors. This information can be lost to colorblind users or users who do not have adequate visual acuity to distinguish between certain colors.</p>

Comments: See 3.1 in this section. However, the best approach is to set up a site definition that integrates this criterion as described in the MSDN article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/odc_SP2003_ta/html/Office_SharePointAccessibility.asp" title="Tips for Enhancing the Accessibility of SharePoint Web Sites">Tips for Enhancing the Accessibility of SharePoint Web Sites</a> in section &quot; Create and Apply High-Contrast Themes to Web Sites.&quot; </p>
It remains the responsibility of SharePoint 2003 developers to ensure that their Web pages satisfy this criterion.</p>
To assess this criterion, a color contrast evaluation tool, such as the <a href="http://www.visionaustralia.org.au/info.aspx?page=628">free downloadable software by Vision Australia</a>, can be used to verify foreground and background color combinations to determine whether the color contrast enables proper viewing.

4.1.4
 Multimedia</h3>
4.1: Can the information that is conveyed by multimedia be provided another way?</p>
Whenever multimedia is used to provide information, it is important to provide an alternative for those who do not have access to multimedia. For example, if a multimedia file is made available on a Web site, it is important to provide an accessible text-based alternative in a standard format, such as RTF, TXT, or HTML.</p>

4.2: Is the Multimedia content synchronized with the alternate support?</p>
If a video with sound is used on a site, as in the case of an interview between several people, it is important to synchronize the alternate support with the picture and the sound in the video. The W3C recommends the use of the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) programming language.</p>

4.1.5
 Tables</h3>
5.1: Is the SUMMARY attribute present and relevant?</p>
If the SUMMARY attribute is used correctly, it provides additional information to disabled users, such as the visually impaired, about the tables in a Web page. If a Web page contains menu bars that are created by using an HTML table, setting SUMMARY=&quot;Menu bar&quot; provides the user with an additional information about the table function.</p>

5.3: In data tables, are the column headers appropriate?</p>
In HTML data tables, the TH tag specifies column headers, enabling users of assistive technologies to use text-to-voice software to determine that they are column headers.</p>

5.4: In a data table, does a HEADERS attribute link to each of the data cells in the table?</p>
When correctly configured in a data table, the HEADERS and ID attributes make it possible to link each data cell to the appropriate column header. This approach enables users that have only a linear view of the table to know which header is linked to the current data cell.</p>

5.5: Is the content in formatted tables in correct sequence?</p>
In formatted tables, the information must be ordered so that it is displayed in an equivalent sequence when the information is read in a linear fashion. Care must be taken when organizing information in a formatted table. HDL development tools that are currently available have a tendency to nest tables within one another. The result is that occasionally differences occur between the visual appearance of information in a graphical browser and the text equivalent, because the latter is based on the structure of the HTML code (as in LYNX-type text browsers, for example).</p>

6.2: Are links explicit enough?</p>
Links must be understandable independent of the page context. Some assistive technologies are able to display a list of available links. These links must be understandable without the context of the Web page to enable rapid scanning. Avoid links such as &quot;click here.&quot;</p>

6.3: Is the TITLE attribute used, if required, and is it no more than 80 characters long?</p>
In HTML, the TITLE attribute is necessary if additional information is required to understand a link. For example, if a link is used to download a file, the TITLE attribute can provide the file name, file size in bytes, file format, and destination (&quot;open in new window&quot;).</p>

6.4: Does the TITLE attribute provide more information about the link than the link title itself?</p>
The only information that some users have about a link is the title of the link or the content of the TITLE attribute. Therefore, the content of the TITLE attribute should, at the very least, repeat the information contained in the link title. For example, a TITLE attribute that simply indicates &quot;this link opens in a new window&quot; is not adequate, because the user does not know the link destination. However, &quot;Read article on tourism in China (new window)&quot; provides all the essential information required about the link.</p>

Avoid using link titles such as &quot;Read article&quot; multiple times on a page. It is important to use link titles that are not identical to help people who wish to move from link to link to read the page more quickly. It is also important to use short, explicit links with unambiguous destinations.</p>

 Scripts</h3>
7.1: If a script requires alternate text to make it accessible, is the information provided by the alternate text equivalent to the information provided by the script?</p>
The information about a script should remain available even if the script is disabled. For example, if a JavaScript script is used to validate an online form, the alternative might be a server-side data entry control. Scripts can be disruptive to users of assistive technologies that do not support scripts or that support them only in a limited fashion. In addition, some users voluntarily disable script execution in standard browsers. For this reason, an alternative must be available to retain the information generated by the scripts.</p>

Comments: WSS 2.0 and SPS 2003 can be used to create Web pages that satisfy this criterion. It remains the responsibility of SharePoint 2003 developers to ensure that their Web pages satisfy this criterion.</p>
However, note that some operations do not work when scripts are disabled and no alternate page is provided. JavaScript scripts are used in menus, in rendering certain pages, as well as in validating online forms. In the latter case, the .NET code determines where controls are applied, depending upon the browser characteristics.</p> <strong> Because the current versions of WSS and SPS are largely based on the use of JavaScript, this criterion might not be satisfied. </strong></p>
7.2:
Can actions be performed even if the peripheral for which they were designed is disabled?</p>
Some functions of a Web site, such as those generated by JavaScript scripts, can be activated only by a mouse click. However, some users cannot use a mouse to browse through a Web site. It must be possible to browse through a Web site by using just a keyboard.</p>

8.3: Is there a TITLE tag in the page header?</p>
In HTML, the title of a page is coded by including a TITLE tag in the document header. Voice browsers list the title of the page first so that a user can get positioned on the Web site. The title is a constant source of support to those having an attention deficit disorder. The tag also makes it easier for search engines to reference the Web site.</p>

4.1.9
 Information structuring </h3>
9.1: Is information structured consistently for the general context of the site?</p>
The structure of information on a page depends on the type of site (news, gaming, scientific, artistic, and so forth). In addition, the individual elements that provide information on the page (such as images and titles) might not be a problem in and of themselves, but the arrangement of these elements in relation to one another might not be consistent. For example, on a news site, no text should be displayed before the title.</p>

Comments: This criterion is subjective.</p>
9.2: Is the Web page presented in a consistent fashion?</p>
Use of styles that are available in HTML, for example H1 and H2, can provide structure to a Web page. Such tags are extremely important in structuring a Web page. For example, the H1 tag indicates a title and the H2 tag indicates subheadings. These tags must be used for their intended purpose, that is, to provide structure, and not for their graphic capabilities. Additionally, blocks of information should be separated from each other.</p>

Comments: SharePoint 2003 technologies do not currently use headers such as H1 and H2 to structure Web pages.</p>
4.1.10
 Information layout </h3>
10.1: Is page content separated from content introduction?</p>
If a page is coded in HTML, it should not contain formatting information (for example, BGCOLOR, FONT, ALIGN, B, I), because all this information can be included in style sheets.</p>

10.2: If style sheets are disabled, is the information still accessible?</p>
To separate content from layout on an HTML page, use style sheets (CSS) to specify the layout. However, people who do not wish to read the page by using the author-selected style sheet should obtain the same information when they disable the page style sheet and use their own customized settings instead.</p>

Comments: It remains the responsibility of SharePoint 2003 developers to ensure that their Web pages satisfy this criterion.</p>
10.3: If style sheets are disabled, is the order in which information appears the same as initially defined?</p>
Style sheets can be used to construct HTML pages. If style sheets are disabled by the user, the logical structure of the page should stay the same as initially defined. For example, the order of appearance of the divisions (DIV) should stay the same when viewed by using a graphical browser or by using a text-mode browser.</p>

4.1.11
 Forms</h3>
 11.1: Are the LABEL tag and its corresponding attributes (ID, FOR) present?</p>
In HTML pages, the LABEL tag is used with the ID and FOR attributes to link data entry fields directly to the associated text. This approach enables people who use assistive technologies to unambiguously determine which data entry field corresponds to the linked text.</p>

11.2: In a form, is the SUBMIT button relevant?</p>
The OK button or Submit button is usually the final validation step in filling out an online form. If this button is not clearly identified, it is difficult for the user to interact with the Web site. For example, if the SUBMIT button is an image, comment the image with explicit text, such as &quot;Submit Form.&quot;</p>

11.3: Is the data entry control in online forms accessible?</p>
If an online form is validated by using a script on the client, for example, provide an alternative to the script so that the user, using any type of browser, can submit the information from the form to the server. Additionally, if an HTML data entry control is used, mandatory data entry fields should be specified explicitly (for example, mandatory fields are preceded by an asterisk). Developers should not use colors to indicate mandatory fields or specify the mandatory fields only at the bottom of the page.</p>

13.3: Is a Web site visitor alerted when new windows appear?</p>
The term &quot;new windows&quot; can refer to two types of windows: new browser windows or pop-up windows. New browser windows are opened by using an HTML command, whereas pop-up windows are opened by using a script on the client side. In some cases, people who use browsers that do not support scripting on the client side or who voluntarily disable scripts in their browser do not have access to the information contained in pop-up windows. If a pop-up window opens automatically whenever a page is loaded, it makes the site difficult to read, especially for people who use assistive technologies for browsing. It is not recommended that new windows be opened, especially if the user is not notified.</p>

When a user downloads files, the following information should be provided: file format, file size, link to a conversion utility if required, link to software needed to read the file format if required, and e-mail address for requesting a file in an alternate format. Files that are available for download on the Web site are not always in an accessible format. Therefore, it is important to provide the necessary means to access the downloadable files. If a file is in PDF format, for example, the user should be provided with the opportunity to download Acrobat Reader software (or a URL for an online conversion utility).</p>

Care must be taken to ensure that specific layout or presentation elements (blinking text, scrolling text, and so forth) do not interfere with the user's ability to access the information: for example, fast blinking text (difficult for most users to read and even more difficult for people with visual disabilities) or fast scrolling information (difficult for people with visual disabilities or for people who have reading difficulties). If this type of presentation or layout is generated by an applet, a FLASH animation, or a GIF file, an alternative should be made available.</p>
