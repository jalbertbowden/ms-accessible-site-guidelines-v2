            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>The notion of digital accessibility, or &quot;eAccessibility&quot;, appeared with the emergence of new information and communication technologies and, specifically, with the advent of the Internet.</p>
            <p>The World Wide Web (generally considered to be the most rapidly adopted technology in history) is now part of our everyday life. Its use is rapidly spreading to all sectors of our society. As such, the Internet is the most global source of information.</p>
            <p>However, people with disabilities might find it difficult to use this medium, as well as other interactive online services in general.</p>
            <p>As Tim Berners-Lee, director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and inventor of the World Wide Web, says:</p>
            <p><i>The power of the Web resides in its universality. Access by everyone, regardless of disability, is an essential aspect</i></p>
            <p>The problem does not reside in physical access to computing equipment (for example, based on certain studies in France, the visually impaired are twice as likely as the national average to have a computer). The real problem lies in the use of the Internet: Web sites browsed by the visually impaired are not always adapted to the assistive devices used, nor do they provide even elementary accessibility features.</p>
            <p>Accessibility takes on additional significance because new technologies represent both an incredible potential and, paradoxically, an additional risk of exclusion for the disabled.</p>
            <p>Accessibility is currently at the forefront of the political scene. It has become a priority  and a legal obligation.</p>
            <p>As an indication of the changing landscape in Europe, we can mention the eEurope 2002 Action Plan concerning the accessibility of public Web sites and their content, which enjoins member states to make their public Web sites accessible to the disabled. Subsequently, at the European Council held in Seville in June 2002, the eEurope 2005 Action Plan confirmed the work of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) launched by the W3C for Web site accessibility (see section

W3C recommendations
            <p>As an example of a recent French application, in February 2005 a law was passed (law No. 2005-102) in defense of the&quot; equality of rights and opportunities, participation and citizenship of the disabled,&quot; mandating on 11 February 2005 (article 47) that online accessibility is an obligation, just as providing physical access to buildings has been for some time:</p>
            <p>All online public communication services of the government and territorial communities and the public organizations under the responsibility of said authorities must be accessible to the disabled.</p>
            <p>France has joined other European countries, such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Great Britain and Sweden that have already passed similar legislation in compliance with European directives and the various action plans and initiatives arising from them. European institutions have committed to comply with current standards in terms of accessibility, and many other organizations within the European Union share this objective.</p>
            <p>In the United Kingdom, the Disabilities Discrimination Act 1999 extends this obligation to commercial private Web sites. Since 2004 the Disability Rights Commission has been given a mandate to initiate public investigations, which can lead to litigations. Courts of laws can order the shutdown of a site until compliance is reached. Spain is taking a similar path with article 10 of the Law on Equality of Opportunities and Against Discrimination (2003), which is being reexamined in Parliament, and Italy has already included all educational products and services in its Stanca Law on Equal Access to Information.</p>
            <p>Most work regulations also require that disabled employees be able to make full use of their employers' intranets and information systems; it is considered to be discriminatory not to enable access to those key productivity tools.</p>
            <p>Additionally, within the framework of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan, the <a href="http://www.support-eam.org/" title="projet Support-EAM">Support-EAM project</a> (Supporting the creation of an e-Accessibility Quality Mark) is intended to standardize the methods used to evaluate accessibility of Web sites, to create a Quality Mark to certify that Internet services are accessible, and to broadly disseminate the use of the Quality Mark throughout Europe. This project makes direct reference to the Council of Europe Resolution 5165/03 concerning eAccessibility, aimed at improving the access of people with disabilities to the knowledge-based society, inviting the Commission and the Member States to &quot;<i>consider the provision of an 'eAccessibility mark' for goods and services which comply with relevant standards for eAccessibility.</i>&quot;</p>

The purpose is to make the information society accessible to all and to make <a href="http://www.einclusion-eu.org/" title="eInclusion@EU">eInclusion@EU</a> a key contributor to the process of inclusion.</p>
            <p>Last on March 27, 2006, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/comm/commission_barroso/reding/index_en.htm" title="Viviane Reding">Ms Viviane Reding, Commissioner for Information Society and Media</a>, chaired the first meeting of the High Level Expert Group in charge of the <a href="http://europa.eu.int/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/what_is_dli/index_en.htm">i2010 digital libraries initiative</a> which aims at making Europe's diverse cultural and scientific heritage easier and more interesting to use online for work, leisure and/or study. It builds on Europe's rich heritage combining multicultural and multilingual environments with technological advances and new business models.</p>
            <p>Within this European context, this white paper is intended to help the reader better understand the issues involved in eAccessibility. We will deal with the current issues in accessibility, as well as the various initiatives and standards implemented with respect to Web-enabled applications. In this regard, we will examine the use of Microsoft products and technologies to design and produce Web sites that comply with accessibility guidelines.</p>
<h2>1.1 Defining eAccessibility</h2>
            <p>Although the problem does not reside in physical access to computing equipment (based on certain studies in France and in the UK, the disabled are twice as likely as the national average to have a computer), people with disabilities encounter real problems when they try to use the Internet and Internet-based services.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, director of the W3C and inventor of the World Wide Web, describes eAccessibility in this way:</p>
            <p><i>Making the Web and Web services available to all individuals, whatever their hardware or software, whatever their network infrastructure, their language, their culture, their geographic location, or their physical or mental aptitude.</i></p>
            <p>In other words, eAccessibility can be defined simply as &quot;enabling any person  whatsoever  to access the Web.&quot; A Web site is accessible if it can be used similarly by anyone  with or without a disability. The content, features and services provided by a Web site must be accessible to as broad a public as possible, regardless of age, disability, or limitations in the technology or user environment.</p>
            <p>To illustrate the magnitude of the issue, more than 750 million people in the world suffer from disabilities. More than two-thirds of them are in the developing world. In the EU alone, 12% to 15% of the population have disabilities. This data, however, does not include impairments such as color blindness (11 out of 100 men), arthritis (110 million sufferers), dyslexia, or temporary impairments due to accident or surgery [1]. Altogether, 330 million people in the EU, which is almost one in two Europeans, need assistive technology for using information technology.</p>
            <p>This data confirms findings from the Forrester research that was commissioned by Microsoft in 2004. The findings from that research stated that 57% of computer users would benefit from assistive technology and 44% of computer users already use one or more accessibility features without necessarily suffering from impairments, simply for ease of use or reading comfort.</p>
            <p>Although some people do not use the services available on the Web because they simply do not have the financial, technical, or other means to do so 
[2]
, many people do attempt to benefit from such services. It thus seems fair and equitable to remove as many of the obstacles to browsing on the Web as possible.</p>
            <p>eAccessibility, in fact, corresponds to a set of technical guidelines that take into account the diversity of these needs and, more specifically, all aspects that might constitute obstacles for the disabled.</p>
            <p>In practice, sometimes very little effort is required to solve accessibility issues. Unfortunately such requirements are often not considered early enough during Web site deployment projects.</p>
            <p> Developers simply might be unaware of what is required in this area. In addition, they might not have access to guidelines that they can use to ensure that their site is accessibility compliant.</p>
            <p><strong>Making a Web site accessible is often perceived as merely providing the disabled with access to digital content. However, Web accessibility provides advantages that go beyond simply facilitating access and ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies for the disabled (see section </strong>

<b>Assistive technologies</b>
<strong>&quot;). The advantages of eAccessibility extend well beyond the disabled.</strong></p>

            <p>When Web-enabled data is designed to be accessible by the disabled, the resulting Web sites are generally more logical and tend to emphasize content rather than merely providing information. A gain of 35% in usability has been noted in a <a href="http://www.drc-gb.org/PDF/2.pdf">2004 survey carried out by the Disabilities Rights Commission</a> in the UK. In addition, maintenance and hosting of content-centric Web sites is generally less expensive.</p>
            <p>eAccessible Web sites can be accessed by using entry-level computers with slow Internet connections, and so forth. They also facilitate portability to other devices, such as Web-enabled mobile phones and PDAs. This advantage is a significant factor, since already in 2004 there were 720 million users of mobile devices.</p>

<a id="_Ref122356730">
1.1.1
Accessibility or usability?</a></h3>
            <p>Although these two notions are closely linked, there are a few essential differences.</p>
            <p>Even if some Web sites are technically accessible, they are not always very easy to use. An accessible Web site is thus not always a usable Web site.</p>
            <p>Whereas the purpose of accessibility is to &quot;open up&quot; a Web site to as broad a public as possible, the purpose of usability is to improve user efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction when accessing the site.</p>
            <p><strong>Accessibility covers technical aspects and considerations, whereas usability concerns the experience of the user when accessing a given Web site. Usability can be compared to the notion of quality in that it is most often noticed when it is unfortunately absent!</strong></p>
            <p>Usability can thus be defined as &quot;the ease with which visitors can use a Web site.&quot; Web usability is not just a matter of making sure that everything works on the site; developers also need to measure how quickly and easily visitors can use the site.</p>
            <p>Jakob Nielsen's law (see <a href="http://www.useit.com" title="useit.com: Jakob Nielsen's Website">useit.com: Jakob Nielsen's Web site</a>) concerning the Internet user's experience probably provides the best definition of the lack of Web site usability:</p>
            <p><i>It is when users spend most of their time on other Web sites</i></p>
            <p>Web site usability involves such issues as user-friendliness and intuitive browsing, as well as download times, page layout, the graphical charter, animations, browsing experience, data architecture, search engine design, and so forth.</p>
            <p>Usability can be evaluated only by the actual experience and satisfaction of the end-user:</p>


Can the user easily find information she or he is seeking?</p>

Are the offered services easy to access, and is the provided information easy to understand?</p>

Is the Web site content presented in a consistent fashion?</p>

Is the structure of the Web site logical and easy to understand? Can the user browse through the site easily and effectively?</p>

Does the site provide a clear explanation of how it is organized and how the user is intended to browse through it?</p>

Is the user able to work interactively with the site and provide feedback? Does the user obtain and provide rapid and appropriate responses?</p>

Is a search function available on the site?</p>
            <p>As illustrated by this partial list of potential issues, the notion of Web usability is extremely far-reaching, and we could not hope to cover all aspects of it in detail.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 Typical misconceptions and misunderstandings</h3>
            <p>Certain preconceived ideas hinder the advancement of widespread accessibility. Some people are convinced that:</p>

<i>The disabled do not have access to computers, so why worry about facilitating Internet access for them?</i> This is untrue; a variety of hardware and software assistive products are available (see section

Assistive technologies

). Moreover, certain surveys in the USA indicate that the hearing impaired, for example, are more than twice as likely as the national average to have a computer.</p>
The Internet is based on the display of graphical images and various other media that cannot be made accessible to everyone the visually impaired, for example. All that is required is a text alternative to pictures, which makes the information readable by a Braille device or text-to-speech software.</p>
<i>Accessibility kills creativity: Accessible Web sites contain only text and, for this reason, they are boring and monotonous. </i>Fortunately, this is untrue. As we have just seen, Web accessibility is not a question of restrictions leading to a Spartan interface, but rather a question of substantial overall improvement. One of the concerns is that non-text content should be accessible to people with disabilities. Major companies provide guidance on how to make animated content accessible. Creating accessible Web 2.0 sites is equally possible.</p>
<i>Basic accessibility features are difficult and very costly to implement.</i> This is untrue; elementary directives exist that, with just a slight effort, cangreatly improve the accessibility and usability of your Web site. In the following chapters of this white paper, we attempt to illustrate some of these ideas as implemented by using Microsoft products and technologies.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 Accessibility starts at the design phase</h3>
            <p>Web accessibility starts right from the design phase. In other words, you must keep accessibility in mind when designing a Web site. &quot;Accessible design&quot; does not mean &quot;minimalist design,&quot; but rather &quot;well-thought-out design!&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>Accessibility is not a constraint, but rather a guarantee that is part of the quality assurance process.</strong></p>
            <p>Each step of the project is involved, from the first brainstorming session, through site development, to maintenance and site monitoring.</p>
            <p>Taking accessibility into account during the design phase has an impact on all levels: ease of use, graphical design, and technical design. The experience of the project team and the solutions, tools, and technologies envisioned should enable the implementation of Web site interfaces that provide high levels of performance and are suited to the purpose, while considering the recommendations of the WAI that deal with accessibility (see section

W3C recommendations &quot;).</p>

            <p>Thus, considering accessibility-related recommendations should come into play right from the design phase, as follows:</p>

Design a graphical charter that supports access for a broad range of disabilities (see section

).</p>
Check whether certain standard user-friendly interfaces are appropriate, and adapt as necessary.</p>
Set up a storyboard taking into account specific criteria, such as data table management.</p>
Define and draft an editorial charter by implementing systematic rules (length of content, use of acronyms, content hierarchy, and so forth).</p>
Select content management tools to ensure that future content will also be accessible.</p>
If experienced screen reader users can be involved, define a testing platform that implements browser testing tools, such as <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/" title="Lynx">Lynx</a> or <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/software_jaws.asp" title="JAWS">JAWS</a>


, in addition to the usual Web browsers. Accessibility validation testing must always be included in the quality assurance process used during the Web development project.</p>
And so forth.</p>
            <p>Each deliverable produced must be assessed to ensure that accessibility criteria are addressed.</p>
<h3>1.1.4 Accessibility is an ongoing process</h3>

            <p>The production phase must ensure strict compliance with standards and rules drawn up during the design phase. Rigor, consistency, and reinforced testing procedures are the key to success in this approach.

</p>
            <p>The use of a flexible and dynamic methodology such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/msf/default.mspx" title="Microsoft Solutions Framework">Microsoft Solutions Framework</a>
(MSF), which is the result <strong> of years of experience acquired by Microsoft development teams and Microsoft consultants throughout the world, makes it possible to maintain </strong><strong>
full control over the management processes and techniques in projects of this type.</strong></p>
            <p>Before describing the current standards dealing with accessibility, we first discuss the various disabilities and the relevant adaptive strategies.</p>
<h2>1.2 Disabilities</h2>
            <p>As we stated at the beginning of this white paper, the Internet can present some significant obstacles to the disabled. To better understand Web site accessibility, we first need to identify the various types of disabilities.</p>

<h3>1.2.1 Types of disabilities</h3>
            <p>Disabilities can be broken down into the following types:</p>

<b>Visual disabilities</b> - This type of disability includes:</p>


<i>Blindness </i>- By blindness we mean a substantial and incurable loss of vision in both eyes.</p>


<i>Weak vision </i>- (This is also sometimes referred to as &quot;poor vision&quot; in some parts of Europe.) Weak vision can include weakened visual acuity (imprecise vision), tunnel vision (vision limited to the very center of the visual field), loss of central vision (vision limited to the periphery of the visual field), or blurred vision.</p>

<i>Color blindness</i> - This condition is characterized by a lack of sensitivity to certain colors. Among the most common types of color blindness are the inability to distinguish between red and green or between yellow and blue. Color blindness can also include the inability to perceive colors.</p>


<b>Hearing disabilities</b> - This type of disability includes:

<i>Deafness </i>- By deafness we mean a substantial and incurable loss of hearing in both ears. Sometimes the mother tongue of a deaf person is sign language, and the person cannot fluently read or write any other language.</p>

<i>Loss of hearing acuity </i> This condition is characterized by slight to moderate hearing loss. People with loss of hearing acuity are sometimes considered to be &quot;hard of hearing.&quot;</p>

<b>Physical disabilities</b> - Physical disabilities include conditions related to impaired motor functions. These conditions might involve weakness or loss of muscular control (such as uncontrolled movements, loss of coordination, or paralysis), loss of the sense of touch, joint problems, or missing members. Some physical handicaps might also include pain that restricts mobility. These disabilities might involve the hands, the arms, or other parts of the body. With 100 million arthritis sufferers in Europe and an increasingly aging population, the number of people with this type of disabilities is likely to grow.</p>

<b>Speech-related disabilities </b>- Speech disabilities or impediments might include difficulties in producing speech that is recognizable by voice recognition software, whether due to weakness of the voice or to lack of clarity in the sound produced.

<b>Cognitive or neurological disabilities</b> - These types of disabilities include:</p>
<i>Dyslexia</i> - People suffering from dyslexia or &quot;math dyslexia&quot; (sometimes referred to as learning disabilities in the United States) might have difficulty understanding written language or pictures (if reading is performed visually), they might have difficulty understanding spoken language, or they might have difficulty understanding figures, either spoken or read.</p>
<i>Attention deficit disorders</i> - People suffering from attention deficit disorders may experience difficulty concentrating on the information presented. Looped animations that cannot be paused will be an issue for them.</p>

<i>Intellectual disorders</i> - People suffering from intellectual disorders (sometimes referred to as learning disabilities in Europe) might need more time to learn or might experience difficulties understanding complex concepts.</p>
            <p><i>Memory disorders </i>- People suffering from memory disorders might have problems with either short-term or long-term memory, or they might lose the use of speech.</p>
            <p><i>Mental health disorders</i> - People suffering from mental or emotional health disorders might have difficulty concentrating on the information provided by a Web site. They might be troubled by blurred vision or trembling hands, which can be side effects of medication they are taking.</p>






<i>Seizure disorders</i> - Some people are subject to seizures that can be triggered by a flickering screen or by a sound of a certain frequency.</p>
            <p><b>Multiple disabilities</b>- People suffering from multiple disabilities might have reduced capabilities for accessing and interacting with information online.</p>
            <p><b>Problems linked to aging</b> - Aging can cause discrete or progressive change in functional abilities or a combination of changes linked to vision, hearing, mobility, and memory. The likelihood of experiencing one or more impairments is three times greater after age 50 than before age 40.</p>
<h3>Assistive technologies</a></h3>
            <p>Assistive technologies (AT) are products used by the disabled to accomplish everyday tasks that would be difficult or impossible to accomplish without such assistance. AT devices are designed to improve accessibility for individuals who have physical or cognitive difficulties, impairments, and disabilities.</p>
            <p>When linked to a computer, assistive technologies include hardware and software solutions providing so-called &quot;disability compensating technologies.&quot;</p>
            <p>Some disability compensating technologies depend on other hardware or software, such as a graphical browser (as opposed to a text-based browser), CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, and so forth.</p>
            <p>There are many <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/at/" title="types of assistive technology products">types of assistive technology products</a> and hundreds of products available. Here are a few examples of AT devices:</p>

Specially adapted keyboard
[4]
</p>
Virtual keyboard
[5]
</p>
Braille pad</p>
Magnification software (screen zoom)</p>
Audible alarms</p>
Screen or paragraph reader</p>
Voice recognition</p>
Optical character recognition</p>
Text-based browsers</p>
Voice-based browsers</p>
            <p>For additional information and user scenario, please refer to the W3C article <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/#usage" title="How People with Disabilities use the Web">How People with Disabilities use the Web</a>, which additionally provides links to various specialized browsers, screen readers, voice browsers, and other access facilitating solutions.</p>
            <p>Microsoft works closely with assistive technology manufacturers in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/at/atvinfo.aspx" title="Microsoft Assistive Technology Vendor Program (MATvp)">Microsoft Assistive Technology Vendor Program (MATvp)</a>. These partners have a proven track record of designing, building, and supporting assistive technology products. According to the right type of assistive technology that might be useful, you can <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/at/search.aspx" title="earch the catalog of assistive technology products">search the catalog of assistive technology products</a> for products compatible with the Windows operating system.</p>
            <p>An AT device sits between a user and an application and allows the user to interact more successfully with that application. The devices translate the application data into a format that the user can access and interact with and, in turn, render the user's input into a format that the application can interpret.</p>
            <p>To function effectively, AT devices must be compatible with the computer operating system and programs on the particular computer being used. Fortunately, developers do not need to understand each AT device. AT devices use a standard object model, such as the Document Object Model (DOM), or a set of interfaces, such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b14f6e1-888a-4f1d-b1a1-da08ee4077df" title="Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)">Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)</a>, to communicate with a client application running on Windows or with an application running on the Web. A wide variety of AT devices are built on this common base (see above).</p>
            <p>MSAA is a set of COM interfaces and application program interfaces (APIs) that provides a reliable way to expose and collect information about Microsoft Windows-based UI elements and, in the present context, Web content. AT devices can then use this information to communicate the UI in alternative formats, such as voice or Braille, and voice command and control applications can remotely manipulate the interface. MSAA comes with its in-depth <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8BC82E65-DBEB-4BC4-9F27-8AC7DF6B7B77" title="MSAA documentation"> documentation</a> and a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=3755582A-A707-460A-BF21-1373316E13F0" title="MSAA tools">set of tools</a>.

).</p>
            <p>However, the MSAA tools can serve as proxies for actual assistive technology devices. These tools are free and easy to use, and can help you uncover the vast majority of accessibility issues.</p>

<h3><a id="">1.2.3 Adaptive strategies</a></h3>
            <p>Adaptive strategies are techniques used to facilitate browsing through Web sites.</p>
            <p>A person who is visually impaired or has restricted mobility can use certain keys on the keyboard as tab keys to jump from link to link and from tab to tab, such as for an online form. These techniques can be used with or without the help of the disability compensating technologies mentioned above.</p>
            <p>These issues are developed in the working document from the W3C entitled <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/Overview.html" title="How People with Disabilities Use the Web">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a>


dated 5 May 2005. This document introduces the use of the Web by the disabled, as well as describes some of the requirements disabled people have when they use Web sites and Web-based applications. Lastly, this document provides information about the work of the WAI of the W3C consortium, which we discuss in the following section.</p>
            <p>We also want to mention here the availability on the Microsoft Accessibility Web site of several guides organized around the various types of difficulties and impairments. These guides are available at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/guides/default.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/enable/guides/default.aspx</a>. Each guide provides a list of assistive technology products and links to Step by Step Tutorials for accessibility features that are helpful for specific types of difficulties and impairments.</p>
            <p>In the context of this white paper, the Step by Step Tutorials for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/ie7/default.aspx" title="IE 7.0">Microsoft Internet Explorer 7</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/ie6/default.aspx" title="IE 6.0">Microsoft Internet Explorer 6</a> Accessibility Options <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/ie7/default.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/ie7/default.aspx</a> might also be helpful.</p>
<h2>1.3 W3C recommendations</h2>
            <p>The<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI" title="Initiative dAccessibilit du Web">Web Accessibility Initiative</a> (WAI) is a special task force that was set up within W3C in 1996 to deal with accessibility issues. The purpose of WAI was to provide the basis for the development of eAccessibility standards through the drafting of a series of recommendations.</p>

<h3>1.3.1 WCAG 1.0</h3>

<h4>1.3.1.1 Overview</h4>

            <p>One of the recommendations published by the W3C/WAI on 5 May 1999 was release 1.0 of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 ">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG</a>


).</p>

            <p>These guidelines explain how to make Web content accessible to the disabled. They were specifically written for all Web content creators (that is, those involved in creating Web pages or designing Web sites) and developers of tools for creating content.</p>
            <p>The main purpose of the guidelines is to promote accessibility for the disabled. However, when a Web site complies with these guidelines, the content is optimized for all users, independent of the program used to access the site, whether classical browser, text browser, voice browser, smart phone, and so forth, and regardless of the constraints imposed by the environment,  such as surrounding noise, excessive or inadequate lighting, or hands-free use.</p>
            <p>These guidelines can enable users to find information on the Web more rapidly. The guidelines are not intended to discourage content creators from using multimedia content, but rather to explain how to make that content more accessible to a broader audience.</p>
            <p>The WCAG 1.0 guidelines establish a stable framework for developing accessible Web sites and help people with disabilities to access such Web sites.</p>
            <p>Today, these guidelines are generally considered to be the standard reference for creating accessible Web content. They have been recognized by most countries since 1999. They have been recognized on the European level since 2002.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, WAI guidelines are considered to be &quot;law,&quot; whereas the WCAG 1.0 guidelines are the actual practical implementation thereof, that is, the &quot;decrees.&quot;</p>
            <p>The WCAG 1.0 guidelines include 14 guidelines that were designed to support forward compatibility to keep up with evolving Web technology, while reducing processing overhead for legacy (older generation) browsers.</p>
            <p>These guidelines are intended to ensure that (X)HTML code is proper and complete; they also state several common sense rules. The (X)HTML code must be compliant from a syntax and grammatical point of view: elements must be properly closed and nested, attributes must be enclosed in quotes, and so forth. Anyone using any type of software should be able to access and use the information provided. For example, images should present alternate text, and data tables should provide a summary, a title, and meaningful headers. A given Web page should be useful even if the browser used does not understand JavaScript, Flash or multimedia elements. Thus, the portions of a Web site that use these technologies should also have a pure HTML equivalent on the same page. However, the code used should be as lightweight is possible and should contain only minimal amounts of unnecessary HTML code to avoid penalizing those who use a text-based browser or assistive technologies (see section

Assistive technologies &quot;). These few examples serve to illustrate the principles of accessibility addressed in the guidelines.</p>

            <p>Each of these guidelines explains how accessibility principles can be applied to the characteristics of a Web site. The guidelines make it possible for the disabled to view Web pages by using existing technical aids (Braille pads, text-to-speech, laser pointing devices, magnification software, and so forth). For example, one of the guidelines indicates that any image should present alternate text so that a visually impaired person can access the information provided by the image. Only the alternate text is readable on a Braille pad or is spoken by using text-to-speech software. It is particularly important that this guideline is strictly followed for Web sites in which only images are used for browsing. Another guideline concerns captions for sound files that provide information to people who are hearing impaired.</p>
            <p>WCAG 1.0 guidelines take all disabilities into consideration and are based on standard Internet technology. However, following these guidelines also ensures that Web sites are usable for everyone, regardless of the computer configuration. For example, some browsers might be configured to display pages without images to speed up surfing. In such cases, alternate text appears in the place of the images and enables the user to obtain the appropriate information. This approach also reduces maintenance costs and improves portability of the Web site to a variety of devices. This advantage is significant, given that already in 2004 there were 720 million users of mobile devices.</p>
            <p>Each guideline in WCAG 1.0 includes a list of checkpoints that apply to it. Each checkpoint describes how the guideline applies to a typical Web development situation and links to techniques that describe, with detailed examples and explanations, how to implement the checkpoint. The 65 checkpoints with their associated techniques can be found at <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS" title="Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 ">Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>. The techniques might (depending upon the topic and the technical area involved) refer to one of the following documents:</p>

            <p>To accommodate the rapid pace of technological change, these documents are regularly updated.</p>
            <p> The WCAG 1.0 guidelines are part of a series of guidelines on Web accessibility published by the W3C/WAI at <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html" title="WAI Guidelines and Techniques">WAI Guidelines and Techniques.</a> It should be noted that the W3C/WAI also provides a home page in other languages.</p>

<h4>1.3.1.2 Priorities and levels of compliance</h4>
            <p>In <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/#Conformance" title="section  5 ">section 5 on Conformance</a>, the WCAG 1.0 document identifies three levels of priorities corresponding to three levels of compliance with the guidelines:</p>
            <p><b>Priority 1</b> - Web content developers must satisfy checkpoints assigned Priority 1. If a Web site does not comply with these checkpoints, some users will find it impossible to access the content on the site. This checkpoint is a basic requirement to enable some groups to use Web documents.</p>
            <p><b>Priority 2</b> - Web content developers should satisfy checkpoints assigned Priority 2 to reduce obstacles in accessing Web sites. If a Web site does not comply with these checkpoints, some users will find it difficult to access the content the site. This checkpoint removes significant obstacles to accessing Web content.</p>
            <p><b>Priority 3</b> - Web content developers may satisfy checkpoints assigned Priority 3 to improve ease of use. If a Web site does not comply with these checkpoints, some users will find it somewhat difficult to access the content on the site. This checkpoint improves access to Web content.</p>
            <p>A list of the relevant checkpoints for each guideline in priority order is provided at <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html" title="Checklist of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0">Checklist of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>.</p>
            <p>The guidelines also define three levels of compliance to simplify comparisons:</p>

<h3><a id="_Ref153114324">WCAG 2.0</a></h3>
            <p>On 8 January 2003, the W3C/WAI published an editor's draft of the WCAG, which was referred to as release 2.0 of the WCAG.</p>
            <p>The latest official release of the proposal [6] as of the writing of this white paper, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20" title="WCAG 20 Last Call">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 - W3C Working Draft 27 April 2006</a>, is largely based on WCAG 1.0 and shares the same objectives: explaining how to make Web content accessible to people with disabilities and how to define target thresholds of accessibility.</p>
            <p>Release 2.0, however, has been enriched by all the feedback and experience arising out of WCAG 1.0 and deals specifically with checkpoints. It attempts to apply checkpoints to a broader range of technologies and uses a language that is more accessible to a heterogeneous readership.</p>
            <p>The W3C/WAI takes great care to ensure that the organizations and people currently using WCAG 1.0 will later be able to move easily to release 2.0 of these guidelines. <strong>WCAG 1.0 is the last approved stable release and, as such, is considered to be the reference, until release 2.0 has been approved. </strong></p>
<h4>1.3.2.1 Main differences between release 1.0 and the proposed release 2.0</h4>
            <p>Since the publication in May 1999 of WCAG 1.0, the W3C/WAI has obtained a great deal of feedback and information with respect to priorities, notably with respect to checkpoints and the usability of the documents provided, as well as requests for clarification about the meaning of certain checkpoints and the appropriate way to comply with certain checkpoint requirements.</p>
            <p>The proposed release 2.0, when it becomes an official W3C recommendation (probably during the year 2007), should, in the light of available documents, accomplish the following:</p>

Be organized more effectively</p>
Adapt the priority of some checkpoints</p>
Modify, remove, and add requirements to reflect changes in Web technology since the publication of WCAG 1.0</p>
Correct errata in WCAG 1.0</p>
Reflect the experience acquired in the implementation of WCAG 1.0</p>
            <p>The organization of WCAG 1.0 is by guideline, each of which links to checkpoints of priority 1, 2, or 3. The checkpoints are the criteria for determining compliance with WCAG 1.0. The most recent version of the proposed 2.0 release is organized by four main principles of Web accessibility design. Each of these principles has its own guidelines, and each guideline has criteria for success corresponding to levels 1, 2, and 3. The criteria for success are used to determine compliance with WCAG 2.0.</p>
<h4>Improvements in proposed release 2.0</h4>
            <p>The proposed release 2.0 of the guidelines for accessibility of Web content provides several improvements over the preceding version. Although the main objective of release 2.0 is the same as WCAG 1.0, that is, to promote Web content accessibility, release 2.0 includes additional objectives, including:</p>

Ensure that requirements can be applied to all technologies;</p>
Ensure that requirements for compliance are clear;</p>
Ensure product ease of use;</p>
Draft guideline text using a language that is accessible to a more heterogeneous readership;</p>
Clearly identify the beneficiaries of accessible content;</p>
Ensure that the new release provides for backward compatibility with WCAG 1.0.</p>

 In Europe, the publication, last on July 5, 2006, of the version 1.0 of the <a href="http://www.wabcluster.org/uwem1/">EU Unified Web Evaluation Methodology (UWEM)</a> is the result of a work undertaken jointly by 3 European projects combined in a cluster called the <a href="http://www.wabcluster.org/" title="WAB Cluster">Web Accessibility Benchmarking (WAB) Cluster</a>, a cluster of European projects to develop a harmonized European methodology for evaluation and benchmarking of websites:</p>
<a href="http://www.eiao.net/" title="EIAO">European Internet Accessibility Observatory (EIAO) project</a>, which aims at establishing, as its name indicates, the technical basis for a European Internet Accessibility Observatory,</p>
<a href="http://www.support-eam.org/" title="Support-EAM">Supporting the creation of an eAccessibility Mark (Support-EAM) project</a>, which aims at harmonizing the Web accessibility in Europe, more particularly on the basis of a unified and harmonized methodology, and at creating a European Web Accessibility Quality Mark for Web sites,</p>
<a href="http://www.bentoweb.org/" title="Benchmarking Tools for the Web (BenToWeb)">Benchmarking Tools for the Web (BenToWeb) project</a>, which aims at constituting benchmarking modules for testing the Web accessibility.</p>
            <p>23 European organizations contribute to these projects.</p>
            <p>The publication of UWEM 1.0 constitutes along with the publication of a <a href="http://www.cenorm.be/cenorm/businessdomains/businessdomains/isss/cwa/design+for+all+in+ict.asp" title="CEN Workshop agreement"> Web accessibility certification scheme</a> the major fact of the year 2006. These two publications make it possible today to organize the effective harmonization of the accessibility of the Web at the European level.</p>
            <p>The UWEM 1.0 methodology is conformant with WCAG
1.0 directives (see section 
REF

1.3.1
 
 REF
_Ref122428714 \h  \* MERGEFORMAT

) and will be synchronized with the foreseen migration from WCAG 1.0 to the proposed 2.0 release (see section

1.3.2
  REF

WCAG
2.0).</p>
            <p>The UWEM 1.0 methodology offers an interpretation of WCAG 1.0. This interpretation is agreed among stakeholders within the above projects. Practical reasons have conditioned this choice. Indeed, WCAG 1.0 are largely accepted and constitute a stable factor of accessibility since May 1999. In 2002 already, the European Union recommended that they are adopted by the public sector of the Member States. In several countries, they are integrated like reference to the national legislation making compulsory the accessibility of public sector Web sites.</p>
            <p>Even the evaluation of UWEM is also designed to contribute to the work of the W3C/WAI on the evolution of the WCAG directives. It should be noted that, if the W3C/WAI has evaluated and provided a contribution to former outlines of this methodology, that does not imply in anyway the approval by the W3C/WAI of whole or part of this methodology.</p>
            <p>The objective of UWEM 1.0 primarily consists in providing a single base allowing at the same time the evaluation of the Web accessibility by a human expert and in an automatic way by machine interfaces.</p>
            <p>UWEM 1.0 primarily covers methods to evaluate documents based on the following technologies: HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 and 1.1, CSS 2.x, and other embedded objects in (X)HTML resources.</p>
            <p>UWEM 1.0 is declined in two levels of conformance:</p>


Priority 1 of WCAG 1.0 - a Web site has the level of priority 1 (P1) if the 54 tests of this level passed successfully;</p>
            <p>Priority 2 of WCAG 1.0 - a Web site has the level of priority 2 (P2) if the 92 tests of this level passed successfully</p>
            <p>The French <a href="http://www.accessiweb.org/fr/Label_Accessibilite/criteres_accessiweb/55_accessiweb_bronze" title="label Qualit AccessiWeb">AccessiWeb</a> Quality Label is the first label in Europe to organize its migration towards the European methodology UWEM and the future European Quality Mark. Indeed, the French organization <a href="http://www.braillenet.org/" title="Braillenet.org">Braillenet.org</a> has released last July 2006 the French translation of UWEM1.0 and a <a href="http://www.accessiweb.org/fr/Label_Accessibilite/accessiweb_uwem1/" title="AccessiWeb/UWEM1.0 mapping">mapping</a> to its existing AccessiWeb guidelines (already conformant with WCAG 1.0).</p>

</a> <strong>Microsoft recognized early on that information technologies are important and empowering tools for people who suffer from disabilities or whose faculties are impaired in some way. For two decades, Microsoft has explored and improved the accessibility features integrated in its products. </strong>Microsoft is committed to innovation in this area (see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/microsoft/mission.aspx" title="Microsoft's Corporate Mission and Accessibility Strategy"> Microsoft's Corporate Mission and Accessibility Strategy</a>) and, with a view to furthering advances in the field, has created the Accessible Technology Group (ATG), staffed by 50 professionals who manage and coordinate all related Microsoft projects, and work with nearly 300 assistive technology vendors worldwide through the Microsoft Assistive Technology Vendor program (MATvp).</p>
            <p>The Microsoft Accessibility Web site and the free <i>Accessibility Update <br> </i>e-newsletter (both at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable">www.microsoft.com/enable</a>) provide in-depth information about the accessibility of Microsoft products.</p>
            <p>Microsoft's commitment to accessibility empowers public authorities by providing opportunities and choice in accessible technologies. This improves opportunities for employment of people suffering from a disability or incapacity and offers better access to public services. Microsoft supports public initiatives, guidelines, and regulations in the drive to encourage eInclusion by providing information about Microsoft accessibility products and the ways in which these products respond to a variety of accessibility standards.</p>
            <p>In the United States, section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that federal agencies make information and electronics technology accessible to the disabled. Section 508 creates a strong motivation for software publishers to integrate more and better accessibility features into their products. This reinforces and extends the work that Microsoft has already done to make technology universally accessible.</p>
            <p>>For more information about Microsoft's public commitment, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/microsoft/section508essay.aspx" title="Microsoft Actively Supports Section 508">Microsoft Actively Supports Section 508</a>.</p>
            <p>In Europe, Microsoft supports the eInclusion initiative of the European Community mentioned earlier and participates in the trans-Atlantic i2010 support initiative.</p>
            <p>Within this framework, the purpose of this white paper is to:</p>

Indicate the level of native compliance of the main Microsoft solutions available today for designing and publishing Internet, intranet, and extranet Web sites, referring to access criteria in the accessibility guidelines.</p>

This is based, among other things, on the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) documents for the corresponding Microsoft products. The VPAT documents, which are available at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/government/section508.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/government/section508.aspx</a>, address the Section 508 standards. Each VPAT document describes how a software product does or does not comply with the standards specified under Section 508.</p>
            <p>Identify the necessary recommendations for the design and production of accessible Web content.</p>
            <p>Propose an approach to assessment and validation using specific tools, before beginning the certification process for the resulting Web site.</p>
            <p>This white paper is concerned with the various Microsoft solutions available today for the design, management, and publication of Internet, intranet, and extranet Web sites.</p>
These solutions not only include:</p>

The new Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007;</p>

            <p>But also:</p>
Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) 2002;</p>

Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 2.0 and Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server (SPS) 2003;</p>
            <p>The wording MOSS 2007 technologies used in the rest of this document covers both Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the wording SharePoint 2003 technologies used in the rest of this document covers both Windows SharePoint Services 2.0 and Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server 2003.</p>
            <p>Finally, MOSS 2007 technologies supersede both MCMS 2002 and SharePoint 2003 technologies.</p>
            <p>As we will see, these products and technologies supports the Visual Studio 2005 development environment, and thus supports .NET Framework 2.0/3.0 and, in part, ASP.NET 2.0 technology.</p>
            <p>ASP.NET 2.0 technologies offer significant improvements for eAccessibility in six areas: accessible images, accessible forms, accessible browsing, accessible data, master pages, and XHTML. All these elements are developed and illustrated in the MSDN article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/aspnetusstan.asp" title="Building ASP.NET 2.0 Web Sites Using Web Standards">Building ASP.NET 2.0 Web Sites Using Web Standards.</p>
            <p><strong>ASP.NET 2.0 technologies are designed to facilitate compliance with all priority 1 and 2 checkpoints in WCAG 1.0, as well as with all section 508 standards. All these guidelines are taken extremely seriously, and it is the responsibility of all developers working with ASP.NET 2.0 Framework to review and test each ASP.NET control with respect to eAccessibility.</strong></p>
            <p>This document is intended to provide technical guidelines for eAccessibility and is to be broadly available to all stakeholders - whether during design, acceptance, or periodic checks on Web sites.</p>
            <p>The framework and the general context of this white paper have now been outlined. We will now outline key concepts to adopt throughout the lifecycle of any web site development project in order to maximize the ability to comply with the WCAG 1.0 checkpoints and will then discuss the Microsoft solutions mentioned previously, starting with Microsoft Content Management Server 2002.</p>
