            <h1>Accessibility Guidelines for Using MOSS 2007 Technologies for Web Implementations</h1><p>Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 provides portal and search features that represent the next generation of SharePoint Portal Server (SPS) 2003 (see previous chapter Accessibility guidelines for using SharePoint 2003 technologies for Web implementations).</p>
<p>However, extra dimensions have been given to MOSS 2007 in Web content management (WCM), document and records management, business process integration and forms, and business intelligence.</p>
<p>As a result, MOSS 2007 constitutes an integrated suite of server capabilities that can help improve organizational effectiveness by providing comprehensive content management and enterprise search, accelerating shared business processes, and facilitating information-sharing across boundaries for better business insight. Office SharePoint Server 2007 supports all intranet, extranet, and Web applications across an enterprise within one integrated platform, instead of relying on separate fragmented systems.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Forms Server 2007, a subset of MOSS 2007, offers a solution that aims at facilitating the form templates publishing and management from a central local.</p>
<p>MOSS 2007 is built upon Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 3.0, which includes into a common architecture many features previously provided by MCMS 2002 (see previous chapter Accessibility guidelines for using Microsoft Content Management Server 2002 for Web implementations), such as web content management, and related workflows. Generally speaking, many tasks such as navigation, summary links, and scheduled deployment that an MCMS 2002 developer would perform can now be performed by users or IT professionals.</p>
<p>Many of the new features in MOSS 2007 are made possible by new WSS 3.0 innovations (and ASP.NET 2.0) such as Master page integration, content types, versioning, and workflows. MOSS 2007 portal sites are created using WSS features and site definitions along with familiar ASP.NET building blocks such as Master Pages and Web Parts.</p>
<p>This means that MOSS 2007 solutions can easily be extended with ASP.NET components such as server-side controls and custom Web Parts as well as custom components that utilize WSS features like custom list definitions, document libraries, event handlers, and workflows.</p>
<p>The white paper <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/08/GatheringMoss/default.aspx" title="Gathering MOSS - New Dev-Centric Features In Office SharePoint Server Keep Your Apps Rolling">Gathering MOSS - New Dev-Centric Features In Office SharePoint Server Keep Your Apps Rolling</a> provided a broad survey of the most significant services and features provided by MOSS 2007 technologies.</p>

<p>Please also note the availability of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms550992.aspx" title="Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Software Development Kit (SDK)">Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Software Development Kit (SDK)</a> and the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms441339.aspx" title="Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 SDK">Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 SDK</a> that include documentation (overview information, step-by-step, and how-to procedures for programming) for the technologies that MOSS 2007 provides for developers, code several examples within the topics, as well as some tips and best practices for using the development platform of MOSS 2007 technologies.</p><h2>Evaluation of MOSS 2007 Web sites for WCAG 1.0 checkpoints</h2>
<p>This white paper evaluates the use of MOSS 2007 technologies for creating Web sites that comply with the checkpoints defined for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#Guidelines">14 guidelines in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0</a>, which were developed by the W3C/WAI and published 5 May 1999 (see section 1.3.1 &quot;WCAG 1.0&quot;). Sometime after WCAG 2.0 is approved and released, a future version of this document will evaluate compliance with the guidelines in
the new release. To assess how MOSS 2007 technologies support and satisfy WCAG 1.0 guidelines, this document considers whether WSS 3.0 and, consequently, MOSS 2007 support the checkpoints, or in some cases, how these products can be adapted to ensure compliance with the checkpoints.</p>This assessment takes into account the following documents: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/c/2/3/c23bc250-5f80-4d0c-a29d-877355ff91e8/Windows%20SharePoint%20Services%203.0%20Beta2%20VPAT.doc">

Office System 2007 Beta 2 Shared Features VPAT</a>
.</p><h3>A More accessible Mode</a><p>On an MOSS 2007 technologies-based site, most user interface (UI) elements, such as links, form controls, and buttons, are designed to use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b14f6e1-888a-4f1d-b1a1-da08ee4077df" title="Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)">Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)</a>. MSAA enables people with disabilities to interact with content by using assistive technologies (see eponym section 1.2.2 Assistive technologies) such as screen readers, which are devices that provide a synthesized speech or Braille description of what a blind or low-vision user is unable to see on a computer screen or Web site. Proper MSAA names are given on all editable controls, links, and buttons.</p>Because some custom UI elements do not use MSAA properties, the More Accessible mode enable to render custom controls as an equivalent standard HTML controls so that they will be better recognized by AT devices. &quot;More accessible mode&quot; is exposed via the Document Object Model (DOM) so that third parties can create solutions catered to screen reader users.</p>alt="Turn on more accessible mode"
src="guidelines-for-designing-and-developing-accessible-web-sites_v2_files/image020.png"src="guidelines-for-designing-and-developing-accessible-web-sites_v2_files/image021.gif"
align=left hspace=12 alt="Turn on more accessible mode"
More Accessible Mode does not enable alternate versions of every UI element. For example, if a custom control has been added to a MOSS 2007 technologies-based site, enabling More Accessible Mode does not automatically create an alternate version of that control.</p>
The More Accessible Mode can be turned on or off by pressing the TAB key immediately after placing focus on the page in a browser. Press the TAB key until you reach the font-style: Turn on more accessible mode or Turn off more accessible mode link.</p>
Even though the link to turn on More Accessible Mode is the first element in the tab orderwhich means that it is the first option when interacting with on the pageyou may need to press the TAB key more than once to activate the feature. This is because the browser menus or toolbars may initially have the active focus. More Accessible Mode changes the way that the page renders for you, not for other users of the site. Because this is a local setting, no one besides you knows that you enabled this setting. More Accessible Mode remains enabled until you turn it off or close your browser. More Accessible Mode enables the following items to be rendered in a way that optimizes them to work better with AT devices such as screen readers:</p>
Menus
- Instead of displaying a drop-down menu of options for files in a document library, a new browser window is opened that contains all of the menu items as hyperlinks. This format is easier for AT devices to interpret. At the same time, the user is informed that a new window will open if he clicks on the menu link; the TITLE attribute contains the Open menu terminology (see point 13.3 in section 
5.1.14
Accessible content
).</p>
Optimized fields - Some fields are difficult for accessibility tools to interpret. When More Accessible Mode is enabled, these fields are replaced with fields that are optimized for accessibility tools. For example, some WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 lists support enhanced text fields that enable users to add formatted text, images, tables, and hyperlinks. Because of the way these fields are rendered in a browser, some accessibility tools cannot read them. When More Accessible Mode is enabled, such fields are replaced with standard plain text fields that are compliant with accessibility tools.</p>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/features/foreveryone/speech.mspx" title="Windows Speech Recognition">Windows Speech Recognition</a>is a speech based assistive technology that is available in Windows Vista. Windows Speech Recognition enables users to perform actions by speaking (in English) instead of using a keyboard or mouse.</p>
There are known issues related to the use of Windows Speech Recognition with some menus on a WSS 3.0/MOSS 2007 page, including the menus for New, Upload, Welcome User and the drop-down menu of options that are available for files in a document library.</p>To access these menus by using Windows Speech Recognition, you need to activate More Accessible Mode by doing the following:</p> 
1.Open the site home page in a browser, and then say, &quot;Press TAB&quot; until the Turn on more accessible mode link appears;
</p> 
2. 
Say, &quot;Press ENTER&quot;;</p> 
3. 
To use a split button menu such as the New or Upload button on a list toolbar, or to use the menu of options for a document in a document library, bring the active focus to the element first by saying, &quot;Press TAB&quot;, and then say, &quot;Press ALT DOWN ARROW&quot;;</p>
A new browser window that contains links from the menu will open.</p>
For menus that have more than one command, say, &quot;Press ALT DOWN ARROW&quot;.</p>In addition to enhanced text fields, several other types of fields are replaced with alternate fields in More Accessible
Mode:</p>
<table>
<caption></caption>
<thead><tr><th>Field in standard mode</th><th>Alternate field in More Accessible Mode</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Enhanced
text field</td><td>Multiple
line text field </p>
</td> </tr>
Graphical summary charts (for surveys)</td><td>Table with table headers (see point 5.3 in section Contact Selector</td><td>Text Field

5.1.6 
Tables
)</p>
</td> </tr>
 <tr>
Gantt chart (in a project list) </p>
</td>
Table with table headers (see point 5.3 in section 5.1.6
Tables
). A table with table headers also appears below a Gantt chart in standard mode.</p>
</td> </tr>
Contact selector </p>
</td>
Text field</p>
</td> </tr>
</table>
Finally, screen reader friendly Instant Messaging presence status and menu interaction on presence enabled people fields. ALT text that describes the presence status on people fields have been added on the WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 sites, and made ENTER the action of opening the menu for these to simplify the keyboard only experience.</p>
5.1.2 Graphics
1.1: Does each graphic have text to display as an alternative to the graphic?</p><em>
In HTML, use the ALT attribute with IMG and AREA SHAPE elements, and so forth. It is important to provide alternate text for graphics because some browsers and screen readers cannot interpret or display graphics properly.</em></p>

Type of criterion: development</p>Can be accomplished: Yes
Comments: WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 sites use by default descriptive ALT text for images that convey meaning or important information to users.</p>
For specific custom pages, templates (see\ 10.1 in section 
5.1.11
Information layout

) and Web pages that satisfy this criterion can be created. You can edit the page with Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007 to take advantage of the tight integration between these products and technologies.</p>
It remains the responsibility of MOSS 2007 developers to ensure that their Web pages satisfy this criterion.</p>
1.2: Is the alternate text for each image relevant to the context in which the image is viewed?</p>
A given image might have several meanings. It is the context of the image that determines the exact meaning. For example, a yellow bullet icon in a newspaper Web site should have the ALT attribute set to ALT=&quot;&quot; or ALT=&quot;*&quot;. However, if the same yellow bullet icon is included in a list of graphics that is available for download, it might make more sense to set the attribute to ALT = &quot;yellow diamond&quot; to distinguish it from other graphics available on the page.</p>

Comments: See 1.1 in this section. This criterion is subjective.</p>
1.3: Are graphics that are used only for decorative purposes commented with ALT=&quot;&quot;?</p>
Some graphics have no informative value. An example is the use of transparent pixels only for layout purposes. However, all graphical elements must be commented. For this reason, graphics that are used only for decorative or layout purposes should be commented by setting the ALT attribute to null (in HTML, ALT=&quot;&quot;). Some browsers do not display the images that use this type of comment.</p>

Type of criterion: development</p>
Can be accomplished: Yes Comments: By default, images that are considered spacer images or have no informational value contained in them have ALT=&quot;&quot;, which tells AT devices
(see section 
1.2.2
Assistive technologies
) that the images do not convey content or information. See also 1.1 in this section.</p>
1.4: Is the alternate text for each image no more than 60 characters long?</p>
You should use a maximum of 60 characters in the ALT attribute because alternate text might bother some users. This is often the case for people who use a screen magnification function because of visual disabilities. It is important to limit the number of characters in the image comments so that such users can minimize the effort required to obtain all the information.</p>

Comments: See 1.1 in this section.</p>1.5:
Are all comments that are linked to clickable areas of a MAP image relevant?</p>
Definition: a MAP image is an image that presents clickable areas so that the user can click to select an option. When you use a MAP image in HTML (on the client or the server side), it is important to include alternate text for all clickable areas, as well as for the MAP image itself (that is, the image that contains the USEMAP or ISMAP attribute).</p>
For a MAP image on the client side, provide alternate text by using the ALT attribute in each of the clickable areas (AREA SHAPE).</p>
For a MAP image on the server side, provide redundant text links that repeat the content of each of the clickable areas.</p>
Comment 1: The alternate text provided for the image that contains the USEMAP or ISMAPattribute must not be null.</p>Comment
2: It is recommended that MAP images be used on the client side rather than on the server side.</p>

Comments:  WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 do not contain and cannot generate standard MAP images.</p>
It remains the responsibility of MOSS 2007 developers, when creating templates (see
10.1 in section 
5.1.11 Information layout
)that use this feature, to ensure that their Web pages satisfy this criterion. The solution is to systematically fill in the ALT attribute that is associated with the tag containing the USEMAP attribute (in addition to the images). Each clickable area (AREA SHAPE attribute) must include an appropriate ALT attribute.</p>
1.6:
Is the alternate content for each text image at least the equivalent of the text appearing in the image?</p>
It is not recommended that you present text in the form of an image. However, if there is an unavoidable graphical constraint (for example, non-equivalent CSS rendering), the alternate text for a graphical element containing text should, at minimum, present the exact content of the text itself. The alternate text can provide additional information, but it must at least provide the exact content.</p>

Comments:
See 1.1 in this section. In addition, when an image file is uploaded to a site, alternative ALT text to that image can be added. For example, the Site Image Web Part contains a field in which you can type custom ALT text when you add an image. When you add pictures to a picture library, you can define custom ALT text for the pictures. </p>
1.7: Do all images that require a detailed description provide comment text?</p>
When a graphical element requires a long description in HTML (for example, a complex image or alternate text longer than 60 characters) a text comment must be provided. The comment can be a link to a descriptive file (for example, a D-link or a clickable graphic), a caption that appears directly on the page, or a LONGDESC attribute.</p>

Comments: WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 can be used to create templates(see 10.1 in section 5.1.11 Information layout) and Web pages that satisfy this criterion.The LONGDESC attribute can be added by using Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007 to edit the page. The best approach is to create a site definition that integrates this criterion.</p>
The WCAG directive specifies that the LONGDESC attribute should be used, but currently most browsers do not support it. Internet Explorer 6.0 exposes this attribute from a programming point of view in its model object. Therefore, assistive technologies can make use of it. <a href="http://www.hackcraft.net/longdesclink/default.asp" title="Longdesc Linker for Internet Explorer 6">Longdesc Linker for Internet Explorer 6</a>
 is a free downloadable ActiveX component that makes it possible to add a Long Description element to the context menu used by Internet Explorer for images. This element is enabled if the selected image has a LONGDESC link. If the user selects the link (by holding down the SHIFT key while selecting), Internet Explorer follows it.</p>
1.8: If a detailed description is provided for an image, is the content relevant?</p>
The content should provide additional information to the description defined in the ALT attribute for the image.</p>

Generally speaking, templates (see 10.1 in section  5.1.11 Information layout)
and Web pages satisfy this criterion can be created that. The solution is to place an ALT attribute between the &lt;IMG&gt; tags embedded in an &lt;A&gt; tag, making sure that the text is relevant.</p>
It remains the responsibility of MOSS 2007 developers to ensure that their Web pages satisfy this criterion.</p>
5.1.3 Frames
2.1: Does each frame have a NAME attribute?</p>In HTML, each frame must be named by using the NAME attribute. Browsing through frame-based Web pages can be complex, especially for visually impaired people who become familiar with site content frame by frame (whereas sighted people have an overview of the entire site). Comment: The content of the NAME attribute should not include any spaces.</p>

Are the names assigned to frames relevant?</p>
The names assigned to frames should be relevant. Avoid naming frames with directional data, such as &quot;Left,&quot; &quot;Right,&quot; or &quot;Middle.&quot; It is better to name frames with explicit names that refer to the function provided by the frame, such as &quot;Menu,&quot; &quot;Navigation,&quot; or &quot;Content.&quot;</p>

Comments: See 3.1 in this section.</p>
WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 natively offer support for High Contrast color schemes: the pages in a WSS 3.0/MOSS 2007 site are designed to display correctly if a High Contrast color scheme is applied.</p>
This is integrated in the site definitions as originally described in the MSDN article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/odc_SP2003_ta/html/Office_SharePointAccessibility.asp" title="Tips for Enhancing the Accessibility of SharePoint Web Sites">Tips for Enhancing the Accessibility of SharePoint Web Sites</a>in section &quot; Create and Apply High-Contrast Themes to Web Sites.&quot;</p>
It remains the responsibility of MOSS 2007 developers to ensure that their Web pages satisfy this criterion.</p>
To assess this criterion, a color contrast evaluation tool, such as the <a href="http://www.visionaustralia.org.au/info.aspx?page=628">free downloadable software by Vision Australia</a>, can be used to verify foreground and background color combinations to determine whether the color contrast enables proper viewing. The identification of proper color visibility is based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast" title="algorithmes du W3C de visibilit des couleurs">algorithms</a>provided by the W3C.</p>

In formatted tables, the information must be ordered so that it is displayed in an equivalent sequence when the information is read in a linear fashion. Care must be taken when organizing information in a formatted table. HDL development tools that are currently available have a tendency to nest tables within one another. The result is that occasionally differences occur between the visual appearance of information in a graphical browser and the text equivalent, because the latter is based on the structure of the HTML code (as in LYNX-type text browsers, for example).</p>

Therefore, the content of the TITLE attribute should, at the very least, repeat the information contained in the link title. For example, a TITLE attribute that simply indicates &quot;this link opens in a new window&quot; is not adequate, because the user does not know the link destination.

The information about a script should remain available even if the script is disabled. For example, if a JavaScript script is used to validate an online form, the alternative might be a server-side data entry control. Scripts can be disruptive to users of assistive technologies that do not support scripts or that support them only in a limited fashion. In addition, some users voluntarily disable script execution in standard browsers. For this reason, an alternative must be available to retain the information generated by the scripts.</p>

Comments: As previously described (see section  5.1.1A More accessible Mode), a more accessible mode allows users with special needs to identify themselves so that the site can change the way some of the dynamic content is rendered. With this mode, the JavaScript menus are rendered as plain HTML links in a new window making it easier for users to interact with the menu. At the same time, the user is informed that a new window will open if he clicks on the menu link; the TITLE attribute contains the Open menu terminology (see point 13.3 in section

Comments: Compared to the SharePoint 2003 technologies, MOSS 2007 technologies provide smarter and more intuitive use of access keys on common commands.The UI controls, features and commands are available directly by using the keyboard. Every action a mouse user can perform is available to keyboard user. For example, the MOSS 2007 technologies offer a keyboard accessible date pickers.</p>
You can press the TAB key and SHIFT+TAB to move back and forth between elements on any page, ALT+&lt;access key&gt; to bring focus to commonly used controls making it easier for users to activate these common controls.The access keys that make sense are privileged while attempting to avoid duplicate access keys on a page and the use of Internet Explorer reserved access keys.Thus, an OK button uses ALT+O on all forms pages.</p> You can also find keyboard shortcuts for many commands at the following Internet address: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA101733621033.aspx">Arial;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA101733621033.aspx</a>.</p>

8.3: Is there a TITLE tag in the page header?</p>
In HTML, the title of a page is coded by including a TITLE tag in the document header. Voice browsers list the title of the page first so that a user can get positioned on the Web site. The title is a constant source of support to those having an attention deficit disorder. The tag also makes it easier for search
engines to reference the Web site.</p>

Comments: Compared to SharePoint 2003 technologies, MOSS 2007 technologies now support multilingual websites. The implementation of a multilingual environment is based on a new concept called &quot;variations&quot;.</p>
This is based on a page or site that is marked as a &quot;source label&quot;. Other languages can inherit from that source label and use the defined settings for its specific language. For additional information, you can refer to the article <a href="http://www.sharepointblogs.com/vandest/archive/2006/06/07/8157.aspx" title="SharePoint 2007 Beta 2: Variations (multi language) on sub sites">Arial;SharePoint 2007 Beta 2: Variations (multi language) on sub sites</a> on Steven Van de Craen's Blog.</p>
Taking into account the adopted approach, a language change should normally not occur on a page. If it does, it probably originates from a WSS 3.0 or MOSS 2007 control.</p>
5.1.10
 Information structuring 9.1:
Is information structured consistently for the general context of the site?</p>
The structure of information on a page depends on the type of site (news, gaming, scientific, artistic, and so forth). In addition, the individual elements that provide information on the page (such as images and titles) might not be a problem in and of themselves, but the arrangement of these elements in relation to one another might not be consistent. For example, on a news site, no text should be
displayed before the title.</p>

Use of styles that are available in HTML, for example H1 and H2, can provide structure to a Web page. Such tags are extremely important in structuring a Web page. For example, the H1 tag indicates a title and the H2 tag indicates subheadings. These tags must be used for their intended purpose, that is, to provide structure, and not for their graphic capabilities. Additionally, blocks of information should be separated from each other.</p>

Comments: Tags are systematically used on WSS 3.0/MOSS 2007 sites to help convey the structure of the page to users of assistive technologies (see eponym section 
Assistive technologies).
This helps AT device users better understand the layout and structure of the pages.</p>
The heading tags (H1, H2, H3, and H4) build a logical outline of the content on a page. If you use an assistive technology such as a screen reader, you can configure it to read only the heading tags on a page. This virtual outline of heading tags helps to improve the clarity of the page content. For example, the home page for a site contains one H1 tag that contains the site title, one H2 tag that contains the page title, an H3 tag around the title of each Web Part.</p>
src="guidelines-for-designing-and-developing-accessible-web-sites_v2_files/image022.png"
src="guidelines-for-designing-and-developing-accessible-web-sites_v2_files/image023.gif"
alt=wssWebPartPage v:shapes="Picture_x0020_7"></p>
Users of certain AT devices can retrieve an outline based on these tags and use it to easily understand the layout of the page and skip to the heading that they want.</p>
As far as screen readers are concerned, this comes with further improvements in terms of navigation compared to SharePoint 2003 technologies.</p>
For instance, each time a user visits a WSS 2.0 home page he will have to listen to the top navigation bar links, left side navigation links and finally the content of the page. The tab order is structured in the same way. Users will have to tab multiple times to get to the page content. In MOSS 2007 technologies, a Skip to main content link helps users to quickly jump to the most important content without having to tab through our navigation links 
(see 12.1 in section 5.1.13 Browsing aids ).

src="guidelines-for-designing-and-developing-accessible-web-sites_v2_files/image025.gif"
Moreover, the reading of the page has also evolved. As an illustration, here is how a screen reader reads the above WSS 2.0 homepage. Items in [ ] are ALT text descriptions, underlined items are links.</p>

Comments: 
Publishing in WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 technologies is fundamentally a means of authoring and displaying information by using a set of templates. There are two fundamental templates to understand: master pages and page layouts.
Master pages (in both WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007) and page layouts (only in MOSS 2007) dictate the overall look and feel of your MOSS 2007 technologies-based site.</p>
Master pages contain controls that are shared across multiple page layouts, such as navigation, search, or language-preference for multilingual sites. Master pages are intended to easily provide a consistent look and feel for the site. They can be used to position items that must be shared by all pages, such as navigational controls, company logos, and copyright notices. ASP.NET 2.0 user controls, Web server controls, and Web Parts can be used within master pages</p>
Page layouts contain field controls and Web Parts. A page layout provides a structured approach to collecting content from content authors and displaying it on a page within a site. Each page layout is based on a WSS 3.0 content type and an associated ASP.NET 2.0 page template. In addition to field controls, an ASP.NET 2.0 page template for a page layout can also contain ASP.NET server
controls and Web Part zones.</p>
It remains the responsibility of MOSS 2007 developers to ensure that their templates satisfy this criterion.</p>
The top-level site for a site collection hosted on WSS 3.0 or MOSS 2007 has a special document library called the Master Page and Page Layout Gallery. All page layouts and master pages are stored in this document library. The Master
Page and Page Layout Galleries support versioning and workflow.</p>
When a content migration from MCMS 2002 is performed, MOSS 2007 creates a set of folders for keeping the Template Gallery structure. In each folder, it generates a basic, default page layout for each template gallery item that was present in MCMS 2002. For additional information, you can refer to the white paper <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnmscms02/html/CMS2002PlanningForMigration.asp" title="Planning MCMS 2002 Application Migration to SharePoint Server 2007">Arial'>Planning MCMS 2002 Application Migration to SharePoint Server 2007</a>
.</p>
10.2:
If style sheets are disabled, is the information still accessible?</p>
To separate content from layout on an HTML page, use style sheets (CSS) to specify the layout. However, people who do not wish to read the page by using the author-selected style sheet should obtain the same information when they disable the page style sheet and use their own customized settings instead.</p>

Style sheets can be used to construct HTML pages. If style sheets are disabled by the user, the logical structure of the page should stay the same as initially defined. For example, the order of appearance of the divisions (DIV) should stay the same when viewed by using a graphical browser or by using a text-mode browser.</p>

As previously mentioned in section

A More accessible Mode, if you want to turn on More Accessible mode, you can do so by pressing the TAB key after the page in the browser has active focus. In addition, if you want to skip repetitive navigation links and go directly to the main content area of the page, you can do so by pressing the TAB key until you reach the Skip to main content link.</p>
Skip to main content links to help visually impaired users quickly jump to the most important content without having to tab through our navigation links.</p>
In addition, standard navigation bread crumbs to assist with site navigation and orienting users on where they are in the site. The pages in a WSS 3.0/MOSS 2007 site use breadcrumb navigation links that identify where the current page or site fits into the overall hierarchy of the site or site collection. These navigation links appear near the top of most pages, under the page name. For example, if you browse to a folder named Reports in the Shared Documents library for the Contoso site, the navigation links may display Contoso &gt;Shared Documents &gt; 
Reports.</p>12.2:

Comments: 13.2: If the user is automatically redirected, is it without using a script?</p>
It is best to use automatic redirection solutions from the server side. In this way, redirection does not depend on the client workstation.</p>

-</p>13.3:
Is a Web site visitor alerted when new windows appear?</p>
The term &quot;new windows&quot; can refer to two types of windows: new browser windows or pop-up windows. New browser windows are opened by using an HTML command, whereas pop-up windows are opened by using a script on the client side. In some cases, people who use browsers that do not support scripting on the client side or who voluntarily disable scripts in their browser do not have access to the information contained in pop-up windows. If a pop-up window opens automatically whenever a page is loaded, it makes the site difficult to read, especially for people who use assistive technologies for browsing. It is not recommended that new windows be opened, especially if the user is not notified.</p>

Comments: Occasionally within a WSS 3.0/MOSS 2007 site, clicking an element opens a new browser window. In such a case, additional information or warnings (through ALT text on image links and TITLE attributes on text links) are systematically provided for hyperlinks that will open a new window to help reduce confusion and improve the user experience. For example, the title attribute of a hyperlink that opens a new window contains (New window).</p>
13.4:
Is there an alternative to scripts for opening new windows?</p>
If no alternative to pop-ups is provided, some users cannot access pop-ups (for example, users whose browsers do not support scripting or who voluntarily disable
scripting in their browser).</p>

13.5: Is additional information available to describe files that can be downloaded from the Web site?</p>
When a user downloads files, the following information should be provided: file format, file size, link to a conversion utility if required, link to software needed to read the file format if required, and e-mail address for requesting a file in an alternate format. Files that are available for download on the Web site are not always in an accessible format. Therefore, it is important to provide the necessary means to access the downloadable files. If a file is in PDF format, for example, the user should be provided with the opportunity to download Acrobat Reader software (or a URL for an online conversion utility).</p>

13.6: Does the specific presentation or layout of information interfere with the ability to access its content?</p>
Care must be taken to ensure that specific layout or presentation elements (blinking text, scrolling text, and so forth) do not interfere with the user's ability to access the information: for example, fast blinking text (difficult for most users to read and even more difficult for people with visual disabilities) or fast scrolling information (difficult for people with visual disabilities or for people who have reading difficulties). If this type of presentation or layout is generated by an applet, a FLASH animation, or a GIF file, an alternative should be made available.</p>

Comments: WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 can be used to createtemplates ( see 10.1 in section 
5.1.11
Information layout )
 and Web pages that satisfy this criterion.</p>
It remains the responsibility of MOSS 2007 developers to ensure that their Web pages satisfy this criterion.</p>
Furthermore, as described in section 
5.1.1
A More accessible Mode, the More Accessible Mode does not limit functionality, but instead enables alternate rendering methods for page elements so that they are compatible with assistive technologies ( see eponym section 
1.2.2
Assistive technologies
).</p>

 Summary
As can be seen by the preceding discussion, MOSS 2007 technologies are capable of producing Web sites that comply with WCAG 1.0 checkpoints in all three priority levels.</p>
This said, throughout the lifecycle of a MOSS 2007 technologies-based project, the design considerations identified in section 
Design checklist for accessible Web content
as well as the ones described in section 
Coding
checklist for accessible Web content
should be observed.</p>
5.2
 Assessment
and validation of a MOSS 2007 Web site for WCAG 1.0 checkpoints</a></h2>The assessment and evaluation of a Web site content based on the MOSS 2007 technologies follow the overall approach and related methods developed under section 
2.3

Assessment
and validation of accessible Web Content
&quot;.</p><p>As indicated, such a validation should begin very early in the project, right from the design phase.</p>
