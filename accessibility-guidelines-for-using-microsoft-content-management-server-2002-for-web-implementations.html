            <h1>Accessibility Guidelines for Using Microsoft Content Management Server 2002 for Web implementations</h1>
            <p>Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) 2002 is a Web content management solution that provides a full range of dynamic and customizable features for implementing Internet, intranet, and extranet Web sites. For example, you can do the following by using MCMS:</p>
            <p>Build dynamic and scalable Web sites that use MCMScontrols (based on the MCMS guidelines) by using the power of the Visual Studio2005 development environment <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> (and, in part, ASP.NET 2.0 technology <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>), Microsoft SQL Server 2005 <a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a>, and standards such as SOAP and XML.</p>
            <p>Deploy Web sites and Web content from one server to another by means of a flexible and extendable content object packaging mechanism that uses XML.</p>
            <p>Enable users who have a minimal understanding of the technical aspects of Web site development to create, modify, publish, and manage their own content by using user-friendly tools that are based on an Internet browser or Microsoft Word.</p>
            <p>Enable authorized content creators to create or modify multiple parts of a single Web site simultaneously by separating content from format.</p>
            <p>For maximum flexibility, MCMS stores content in XML, HTML, and binary objects in a Microsoft SQL Server repository. Content is thus managed separately from design elements or templates that are used to produce the Web site. Web site templates (ASPX, ASP, or ASCX source files) can be used to define the overall appearance for a set of pages in a MCMS Web site and can contain executable code.</p>
            <p>These templates and the executable code are stored at the file system level, and can be managed by using a source code management system, such as Microsoft Visual Source Safe or Microsoft Visual Studio Team System (Team Foundation Source Control).</p>
            <p>Because MCMS integrates code dynamically in a Web site through template objects, Web pages can be produced and published dynamically. In this way, content can be customized as a function of user profile and behavior, Internet browser, or default language. Managing objects separately makes it possible to rapidly adapt content as a function of a variety of applications employed by the organization and outside partners.</p>
            <p>Lastly, a connector, theMicrosoft Content Management Server 2002 Connector for SharePoint Technologies, makes it possible to integrate SharePoint technologies (see chapter 3 &quot; Accessibility guidelines for using SharePoint 2003 technologies for Web implementations &quot;) with MCMS 2002 to provide an end-to-end solution for document publication.</p>
            <p>For additional information about MCMS, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/cmserver/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/cmserver/default.mspx</a>.</p>
            <h2>3.1 Evaluation of MCMS 2002 Web sites for WCAG 1.0 checkpoints</a></h2>
            <p>This white paper evaluates the use of MCMS for creating Web sites that comply with the priority 1 checkpoints defined for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#Guidelines">14 guidelines in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0</a>, which were developed by the W3C/WAI and published 5 May 1999 (see section 1.3.1 &quot;WCAG 1.0&quot;). Sometime after WCAG 2.0 is approved and released, a future version of this document will evaluate compliance with the guidelines in the new release.</p>
            <p>To evaluate the use of MCMS 2002 for creating compliant Web sites, this document considers the following two areas:</p>
            <p>Template creation by using a template designer. This area includes the browsing mechanisms that are set up for the Web site.</p>
            <p>Content, that is created by users who have been granted appropriate author or editor permissions. The Web content is created for each page by using placeholders.</p>
            <p>MCMS 2002 is evaluated for each checkpoint with respect to its content authoring tools (as they exist without development) and, if applicable, the possibility of workarounds to comply with the checkpoints.</p>
            <p>As mentioned in the introduction, this assessment takes into consideration the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/c/2/3/c23bc250-5f80-4d0c-a29d-877355ff91e8/Content_Management_Server_2002_VPAT.doc" title="VPAT de MCMS 2002">Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) for MCMS 2002</a>.</p>
            <p>The MCMS 2002 release examined is the latest available as of the publication date of this white paper: Microsoft Content Management Server 2002 with Service Pack 2.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=3de1e8f0-d660-4a2b-8b14-0fce961e56fb&amp;DisplayLang=en" title="MCMS 2002 Service Pack 2">Service Pack 2</a> requires prior installation of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=62049d3f-24d7-4463-a924-550e5dc34095&amp;DisplayLang=en" title="MCMS 2002 Service Pack 1a">Service Pack 1a</a>, which in turn requires prior installation of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=FAC6350C-8AD6-4BCA-8860-8A6AE3F64448&amp;displaylang=en" title="Internet Explorer Web Controls for Content Management Server 2002 with Service Pack 1a">Internet Explorer Web Controls for Content Management Server 2002 with Service Pack 1a</a>. We suggest that you begin by reading the following articles:</p>
            <p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?id=906145" title="Content Management Server 2002 Service Pack 2 installation information">Content Management Server 2002 Service Pack 2 installation information</a></p>

            <p>MCMS 2002 Service Pack 2 supports .NET Framework 2.0 and the Visual Studio 2005 development environment. It should be noted that Visual Studio can be used to develop XHTML-compliant templates that are automatically validated during the design process.</p>
            <p>By default, Visual Studio 2005 is configured to check Web pages for Internet Explorer 6.0 requirements. If you wish to check Web pages for a specific XHTML scheme, you need to select one of the XHTML schemes by selecting Tools Options Validation.</p>
            <p>Validation errors, such as unclosed statements, are indicated in the Source view by a red wavy line under the content where the problem occurs. Syntax errors, such as the use of an obsolete marker, are underlined with a green wavy line. Explanatory tips are displayed when the mouse pointer hovers over a syntax error. These messages can also be displayed in the error list ( View Other Windows Error List).</p>
            <p>By using the new Accessibility Validation tool in Visual Studio 2005, you can validate your Web pages against several different accessibility standards. Access the tool by selecting  Tools Check Accessibility. You can use this function to validate your Web pages against WCAG Priorities 1 and 2 and Section 508 directives. You can also display the validation results in the error list.</p>
            <p>See the MSDN article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/aspnetusstan.asp" title="Building ASP.NET 2.0 Web Sites Using Web Standards">Building ASP.NET 2.0 Web Sites Using WebStandards</a>, which describes these features in detail.</p>
            <h3>3.1.1 Graphics</h3>
            <p>1.1: Does each graphic have text to display as an alternative to the graphic?</p>
In HTML, use the ALT attribute with IMG and AREA SHAPE elements, and so forth. It is important to provide alternate text for graphics because some browsers and screen readers cannot interpret or display graphics properly.</em></p>

Can be accomplished by using author content: Yes</p>
Comments: Template developers have full control over the HTML used in the template. It is possible to create templates that satisfy this criterion. It is the responsibility of developers to ensure that the HTML code they produce does so.</p>
The  ImagePlaceholder control that is available in the standard version of MCMS 2002 enables content authors to insert images that have an assigned ALT attribute.</p>
Similarly, the HTMLPlaceholder control that is available in the standard version of MCMS 2002 enables content authors to insert images that also can have an ALT attribute. It is the responsibility of Web masters and content authors to ensure that their Web pages comply with this checkpoint.</p>
1.2: Is the alternate text for each image relevant to the context in which the image is viewed?</p>
A given image might have several meanings. It is the context of the image that determines the exact meaning. For example, a yellow bullet icon in a newspaper Web site should have the ALT attribute set to ALT=&quot;&quot; or ALT=&quot;*&quot;. However, if the same yellow bullet icon is included in a list of graphics that is available for download, it might make more sense to set the attribute to ALT = &quot;yellow diamond&quot; to distinguish it from other graphics available on the page.</p>

1.3:
Are graphics that are used only for decorative purposes commented with
ALT=&quot;&quot;?</p>
Some graphics have no informative value. An example is the use of transparent pixels only for layout purposes. However, all graphical elements must be commented. For this reason, graphics that are used only for decorative or layout purposes should be commented by setting the ALT attribute to null (in HTML, ALT=&quot;&quot;). Some browsers do not display the images that use this type of comment.</p>

1.4:
Is the alternate text for each image no more than 60 characters long?</p>
You should use a maximum of 60 characters in the ALT attribute because alternate text might bother some users. This is often the case for people who use a screen magnification function because of visual disabilities. It is important to limit the number of characters in the image comments so that such users can minimize the effort required to obtain all the information.</p>

Comments:
See 1.1 in this section.</p>
1.5:
Are all comments that are linked to clickable areas of a MAP image relevant?</p>
Definition:
A MAP image is an image that presents clickable areas so that the user can click to select an option. When you use a MAP image in HTML (on the client or the server side), it is important to include alternate text for all clickable areas, as well as for the MAP image itself (that is, the image that contains the USEMAP or ISMAP attribute).</p>
For a MAP image on the client side, provide alternate text by using the ALT attribute in each of the clickable areas (AREA SHAPE).</p>
For a MAP image on the server side, provide redundant text links that repeat the content of each of the clickable areas.</p>
Comment
1: The alternate text provided for the image that contains the USEMAP or ISMAPattribute must not be null.</p>
Comment
2: It is recommended that MAP images be used on the client side rather than on the server side.</p>

Comments: Template developers have full control over the HTML used in the template. It is possible to create templates that satisfy this criterion. It is the responsibility of developers to ensure that the HTML code they produce does so.</p>

Content authors cannot create map images on the
client or server side by using the standard publishing controls in MCMS 2002.</p>
1.6:
Is the alternate content for each text image at least the equivalent of the
text appearing in the image?</p>


It is not recommended that you present text in the form of an image. However, if there is an unavoidable graphical constraint (for example, non-equivalent CSS rendering), the alternate text for a graphical element containing text should, at minimum, present the exact content of the text itself. The alternate text can provide additional information, but it must at least provide the exact content.</p>

1.7:
Do all images that require a detailed description provide comment text?</p>
When a graphical element requires a long description in HTML (for example, a complex image or alternate text longer than 60 characters), a text comment must be provided. The comment can be a link to a descriptive file (for example, a D-link or a clickable graphic), a caption that appears directly on the page, or a LONGDESC attribute.</p>

Type of criterion: development</p> 
Can be accomplished by using templates: Yes</p>
Can be accomplished by using author content: Yes</p>
Comments:
Template developers have full control over the HTML used in the template. It is possible to create templates that satisfy this criterion. It is the responsibility of developers to ensure that the HTML code they produce does so.</p>
The ImagePlaceholder and HTMLPlaceholder controls that are provided in the standard version of MCMS 2002 do not support the use of the LONGDESC attribute.</p>
The controls can be modified to support this feature.</p>
Another possible approach is to use a WYSIWYG content editor control instead. <a href="http://www.mcmscontrols.com/Default.aspx?PageId=2366" title="r.a.d.editor Lite Edition"> The r.a.d.editor Lite Edition</a>, developed by Telerik and available without additional cost for all MCMS 2002 clients , makes it possible to create and manage rich, accessible HTML content. The content generated by r.a.d.editor is accessible if the author fills in all the required fields (identified by a special accessibility icon). Any content element that is more complex than simple text provides accessibility fields that support a complete description, including long description support.</p>
It should be noted that this software publisher also offers a full range of controls for MCMS 2002. These controls are available in the <a href="http://www.mcmscontrols.com/Default.aspx?PageId=2341" title="r.a.d.controls suite MCMS Edition"> r.a.d.controls suite MCMS Edition</a>. This suite offers, in addition to other features, the <a href="http://www.mcmscontrols.com/Default.aspx?PageId=2357" title="r.a.d.editor Premium Edition"> r.a.d.editor Premium Edition</a> control, which is an extended version of the control mentioned above.</p>
It is the responsibility of Web masters and content authors to ensure that their Web pages comply with this checkpoint.</p>
The WCAG directive specifies that the LONGDESC attribute should be used, but currently most browsers do not support this attribute. Internet Explorer 6.0 exposes this attribute from a programming point of view in its object model. Assistive technologies might thus make use of this feature. <a href="http://www.hackcraft.net/longdesclink/default.asp" title="Longdesc Linker for Internet Explorer 6">Longdesc Linker for Internet Explorer 6</a> is a free downloadable ActiveX component that makes it possible to add a Long Description element to the context menu used by Internet Explorer for images. This element is enabled if the selected image has a LONGDESC link. If the user selects the link (by holding down the SHIFT key while selecting), Internet Explorer follows it.</p>
1.8: If a detailed description is provided for an image, is the content relevant?</p>
The content should provide additional information to the description defined in the ALT attribute for the image.</p>

The image description is not always in keeping with the function of the link. For example, if an arrow is used to indicate a link, use ALT=&quot;Next&quot; instead of ALT=&quot;Right Arrow&quot;. Avoid using ALT=&quot;&quot;, which provides no information about the function of the link.</p>

3.1.2 Frames</h3>
2.1: Does each frame have a NAME attribute?</p>
In HTML, each frame must be named by using the NAME attribute. Browsing through frame-based Web pages can be complex, especially for visually impaired people who become familiar with site content frame by frame (whereas sighted people have an overview of the entire site). Comment: the content of the NAME attribute should not include any spaces.</p>

Template developers have full control over the HTML used in the template. It is possible to create templates that satisfy this criterion.
It is the responsibility of developers to ensure that the HTML code they produce does so.</p>
We do not recommend the use of frames in templates. If, however, frames are used, the Frameset Document Type Definition (DTD) for XHTML 1.0 should be used (see 8.1 under &quot;Mandatory elements&quot;).</p>
Content authors cannot manipulate frames in MCMS 2002.</p>
2.2:
Are the names assigned to frames relevant?</p>
The names assigned to frames should be relevant. Avoid naming frames with directional data, such as &quot;Left,&quot; &quot;Right,&quot; or &quot;Middle.&quot; It is better to name frames with explicit names that refer to the function provided by the frame, such as &quot;Menu,&quot; &quot;Navigation,&quot; or &quot;Content.&quot;</p>

 Colors
</h3>
3.1: Is information provided by color still readable when colors are disabled?</p>
Web site designers must be particularly careful about information provided by colors. This information can be lost to color-blind users or users who do not have adequate visual acuity to distinguish between certain colors.</p>

3.2:
Is there enough contrast between colors to be distinguishable by users who have
impaired color vision?</p>
Some color combinations should be avoided, such as red with blue, yellow with violet, yellow with green, as so forth. When there is not enough contrast between colors on a page, the information provided by contrast might not be accessible to users with poor or impaired color vision.</p> WCAG 1.0 checkpoint(s) [Priority 1]: -</p>

Comments: See comments for 3.1 in this section. A link can be provided to a high contrast version of the Web site. CSS style sheets must be used so that users can automatically apply a different style sheet when they read Web site content. This configuration can be saved for a Web page by using cookies. Additionally, content authors and graphics designers must be aware of the difficulties in using media where this problem can occur. Graphics designers should consider this criterion when they create images. All images in the resource repository should comply with this criterion.</p>
To assess this criterion, a color contrast evaluation tool, such as the <a href="http://www.visionaustralia.org.au/info.aspx?page=628">free downloadable software by Vision Australia</a>, can be used to verify foreground and background color combinations to determine whether the color contrast enables proper viewing. The identification of proper color visibility is based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast" title="algorithmes du W3C de visibilit des couleurs">algorithms</a> provided by the W3C.</p>
3.1.4 Multimedia</h3>
4.1: Can the information that is conveyed by multimedia be provided another way?</p>
Whenever multimedia is used to provide information, it is important to provide an alternative for those who do not have access to multimedia. For example, if a multimedia file is made available on a Web site, it is important to provide an accessible
text-based alternative in a standard format, such as RTF, TXT, or HTML.</p>

3.1.5 Tables</h3>
5.1: Is the SUMMARY attribute present and relevant?</p>
If the SUMMARY attribute is used correctly, it provides additional information to disabled users, such as the visually impaired, about the tables in a Web page. If a Web page contains menu bars that are created by using an HTML table, setting SUMMARY=&quot;Menu bar&quot; provides the user with additional information about the table function.</p>

Comments: Template developers have full control over the HTML used in the template. It is possible to create templates that satisfy this criterion. It is the responsibility of developers to ensure that the HTML code they produce does so.</p>
For author content, the HTMLPlaceholder control that is provided in the standard release of MCMS 2002 does not enable this functionality. A customized control can be developed that inherits from the original HtmlPlaceholder control to provide this support.</p>
The best approach is to use a WYSIWYG content editor control instead. <a href="http://www.mcmscontrols.com/Default.aspx?PageId=2366" title="r.a.d.editor Lite Edition">The r.a.d.editor Lite Edition</a>, developed by Telerik and available without additional cost for all MCMS 2002 clients, makes it possible to create and manage rich, accessible HTML content. The content generated by r.a.d.editor is accessible if the author fills in all the required fields (identified by a special accessibility icon). Any content element that is more complex than simple text provides accessibility fields that support a complete description.</p>
It should be noted that this software publisher also offers a full range of controls for MCMS 2002. These controls are available in the <a href="http://www.mcmscontrols.com/Default.aspx?PageId=2341" title="r.a.d.controls suite MCMS Edition">r.a.d.controls suite MCMS Edition</a>.

5.2: In a data table, does the CAPTION tag provide the title of the table?</p>
Rather than using formatted text to provide the title of a table, it is better to use the CAPTION tag, which is the tag dedicated to displaying table titles.</p>

5.5: Is the content in formatted tables in correct sequence?</p>
In formatted tables, the information must be ordered so that it is displayed in an equivalent sequence when the information is read in a linear fashion. Care must be taken when organizing information in a formatted table. HDL development tools that are currently available have a tendency to nest tables within one another. The result is that occasionally differences occur between the visual appearance of information in a graphical browser and the text equivalent, because the latter is based on the structure of the HTML code (as in LYNX-type text browsers, for example).</p>

6.2: Are links explicit enough?</p>
Links must be understandable independent of the page context. Some assistive technologies are able to display a list of the available links. These links must be understandable without the context of the Web page to enable rapid scanning. Avoid links such as &quot;click here.&quot;</p>

6.4: Does the TITLE attribute provide more information about the link than the link title itself?</p>
The only information that some users have about a link is the title of the link or the content of the TITLE attribute. Therefore, the content of the TITLE attribute should, at the very least, repeat the information contained in the link title. For example, a TITLE attribute that simply indicates &quot;this link opens in a new window&quot; is not adequate, because the user does not know the link destination. However, &quot;Read article on tourism in China (new window)&quot; provides all the essential information required about the link.</p>

3.1.7 Scripts</h3>
7.1: If a script requires alternate text to make it accessible, is the information provided by the alternate text equivalent to the information provided by the script?</p>
The information about a script should remain available even if the script is disabled. For example, if a JavaScript script is used to validate an online form, the alternative might be a server-side data entry control. Scripts can be disruptive to users of assistive technologies that do not support scripts or that support them only in a limited fashion. In addition, some users voluntarily disable script execution in standard browsers. For this reason, an alternative must be available to retain the information generated by the scripts.</p>

Can be accomplished by using author content: N/A</p>
Comments: Template developers have full control over the HTML used in the template. It is possible to create templates that satisfy this criterion. It is the responsibility of developers to ensure that the HTML code they produce does so.</p>
Most .NET ASP controls assume that the Web client supports scripts (the &quot;postback&quot; concept in ASP.NET). For example, when a user clicks on a .NET ASP button that has an associated OnClick event, it causes the browser event handler to execute a script function that, in turn, sends the HTML form.</p>
In such cases, .NET ASP controls that require this function should not be used; only basic HTML controls and elements should be used. For this reason, data must be entered by using query strings, or by submitting the online form without scripts, using HTML Submit buttons.</p>
If scripts are used to present content interactively, a text equivalent should be provided by placing static text within the elements.</p> &lt;object&gt; and &lt;applet&gt; tags must also provide alternate text for the element content.</p>
It is not possible to use standard MCMS controls in the MCMS 2002 author interface to add this information to this type of object. Customized placeholders must be developed if these objects are required.</p>
7.2: Can actions be performed even if the peripheral for which they were designed is disabled?</p>
Some functions of a Web site, such as those generated by JavaScript scripts, can be activated only by a mouse click. However, some users cannot use a mouse to browse through a Web site. It must be possible to browse through a Web site by using just a keyboard.</p>

3.1.8 Mandatory elements </h3>
8.1: Is the DOCTYPE tag present at the beginning of the page source code?</p>
International WAI guidelines suggest using an appropriate and valid Document Type Definition (DTD) to indicate the type of electronic document that the browser must load (frame-based, HTML, XML, and so forth). In HTML, the DOCTYPE tag is required to define the document type.</p>

Template developers have full control over the HTML used in the template. It is possible to create templates that satisfy this criterion. It is the responsibility of developers to ensure that the HTML code they produce does so.</p>
For template developers, we recommend using XHTML 1.0 Transitional.</p>
Please note the following points:</p>
Visual Studio 2003 modifies the HTML code when you switch from Design view to HTML view. The resulting HTML code that is modified by Visual Studio might violate some rules. For example, HTML tags in lowercase letters might switch to uppercase (uppercase tags do not comply with XHTML 1.0 Transitional). Quotation marks in some HTML attributes might be removed. To prevent some of these modifications from occurring, disable &quot; Apply Automatic Formatting  when switching from design to HTML view&quot; in the Visual Studio options. Visual Studio 2005, which is supported by MCMS 2002 Service Pack 2, no longer behaves in this way.</p>
In the past, the HtmlPlaceHolder control violated several XHTML 1.0 Transitional syntax rules. These problems were corrected in Service Pack 1a, as mentioned previously. For additional information, refer to article 821969 <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;821969" title="MCMS 2002 ActiveX Control Is Not Compliant with HTML 4.01">MCMS 2002 ActiveX Control Is Not Compliant with HTML 4.01</a>

In the past, the HTML code generated by the console included a &lt;javascript&gt; tag but not the linked attribute, which does not comply with XHTML 1.0. This problem was corrected in Service Pack 1a, as mentioned previously.

Lastly, MCMS 2002 Service Pack 2 provides support for ASP.NET 2.0 Master Pages. When you use Master Pages, you can integrate the appropriate DOCTYPE tags throughout the pages of a Web site. The SiteMaster.master includes a DOCTYPE tag. There is an obvious advantage to specifying the DOCTYPE tag in a Master Page: when the tag needs to be modified in the future, it can be modified in a single location to be applied to all the pages on the Web site. See the MSDN article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/aspnetusstan.asp" title="Building ASP.NET 2.0 Web Sites Using Web Standards">font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Building ASP.NET 2.0 Web Sites Using Web Standards</a> for additional information.</p>
8.2: Is the LANG attribute present at the beginning of the page source code to
clearly identify the language used?</p>
It is important to specify the language of a document to enable assistive technologies to adapt content to the language. In HTML, the LANG attribute in the HTML tag specifies the language.</p>

8.3: Is there a TITLE tag in the page header?</p>
In HTML, the title of a page is coded by including a TITLE tag in the document header. Voice browsers list the title of the page first so that a user can get positioned on the Web site. The title is a constant source of support to those having an attention deficit disorder. The tag also makes it easier for search engines to reference the Web site.</p>

3.1.9 Information structuring </h3>
9.1: Is information structured consistently for the general context of the site?</p> The structure of information on a page depends on the type of site (news, gaming, scientific, artistic, and so forth). In addition, the individual elements that provide information on the page (such as images and titles) might not be a problem in and of themselves, but the arrangement of these elements in relation to one another might not be consistent. For example, on a news site, no text should be displayed before the title.</p>

Similarly, content authors should keep this criterion in mind.</p>
9.2: Is the Web page presented in a consistent fashion?</p>
Use of styles that are available in HTML, for example H1 and H2, can provide structure to a Web page. Such tags are extremely important for structuring a Web page. For example, the H1 tag indicates a title and the H2 tag indicates subheadings. These tags must be used for their intended purpose, that is, to provide structure, and not for their graphic capabilities. Additionally, blocks of information should be separated from each other.</p>

Information layout </a></h3>
10.1: Is page content separated from content introduction?</p>If a page is coded in HTML, it should not contain layout information (for example, BGCOLOR, FONT, ALIGN, B, I), because all this information can be included in a style sheet.</p>

Template developers have full control over the HTML used in the template. It is possible to create templates that satisfy this criterion. It is the responsibility of developers to ensure that the HTML code they produce does so.</p>
Content authors do not have the same degree of control: author content cannot be positioned by using style sheets with the standard  HtmlPlaceholder control.

10.2: If style sheets are disabled, is the information still accessible?</p>
To separate content from layout on an HTML page, use style sheets (CSS) to specify the layout. However, people who do not wish to read the page by using the author-selected style sheet should obtain the same information when they disable the page style sheet and use their own customized settings instead.</p>

Comments: 
Template developers have full control over the HTML used in the template. It is possible to create templates that satisfy this criterion. It is the responsibility of developers to ensure that the HTML code they produce does so.</p>
Most .NET ASP controls assume that the Web client supports scripts (the &quot;postback&quot; concept in ASP.NET). For example, when a user clicks on a .NET ASP button that has an associated OnClick event, it causes the browser event handler to execute a script function that, in turn, sends the HTML form.</p>
In such cases, .NET ASP controls that require this function should not be used; only basic HTML controls and elements should be used. For this reason, data must be entered by using query strings or by submitting the online form without scripts, using HTML Submit buttons.</p>
&lt;object&gt; and &lt;applet&gt; tags must also provide alternate text for the element content.</p>

Content authors cannot create or manipulate tab indexes by using standard content editing controls (placeholders). If a content author creates hyperlinks in the Web content, the hyperlinks should be displayed sequentially as a user chooses the Tab button to move from one link to the next.</p>
Accepted practice is to create separate blocks in the template and provide tab index values within each block by assigning a unique tab index range to each, that is, 100-200, 200-300, and so forth. This approach enables consistent and orderly browsing. In this way, the user can browse through all the available content.</p>

The term &quot;new windows&quot; can refer to two types of windows: new browser windows or pop-up windows. New browser windows are opened by using an HTML command, whereas pop-up windows are opened by using a script on the client side. In some cases, people who use browsers that do not support scripting on the client side or who voluntarily disable scripts
in their browser do not have access to the information contained in pop-up windows. If a pop-up window opens automatically whenever a page is loaded, it makes the site difficult to read, especially for people who use assistive technologies for browsing. It is not recommended that new windows be opened, especially if the user is not notified.</p>

Care must be taken to ensure that specific layout or presentation elements (blinking text, scrolling text, and so forth) do not interfere with the user's ability to access the information: for example, fast blinking text (difficult for most users to read and even more difficult for people with visual disabilities) or fast scrolling information (difficult for people with visual disabilities or for people who have reading difficulties). If this type of presentation or layout is generated by an applet, a FLASH animation, or a GIF file, an alternative should be made available.</p>
